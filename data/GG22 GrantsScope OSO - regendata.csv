Firstly I'd like it to be hosted on a website to let anybody to access it from any device. Secondly, I'd like to integrate blockchain technology. People can own the actual character that they create and play as. And then we can reward their in-game progress with some sort of currency system. Either by giving them a token specific to our universe or by adding perks to the character they own.
 
 My goal would be to make the game as much of a social experience as possible. I want to build a giant hub. Fill it with games, interactive activities, stuff to build, stuff to buy, and missions to complete. There will be a chat and text system so people can communicate. And we will set the game up in a way to try and encourage communal play. Check out this DJ set at 7. Come to this raid at 3. Weeklong building competition. Stuff like that. The more collaborative this process the better. We can invite other IP's, companies, and artists to build areas in our world. This should exponentially increase the reach of community building that is possible. 
 
 I want to make the project accessible to as many people as possible. I'm sure typical gamers will make up the majority. We hope to attract musicians by giving them a digital place to hold shows. We hope to attack artist by giving them a new place to show their work. We hope to attract filmmakers by giving them a new place to host premieres. We hope to attack the casual social media user who is just looking for new experiences. The majority of the demographic above will bring their own audience with them. If we can snowball all the momentum who knows what kind of audience we can attract. 
 
 We will spend the majority of the grand funding on game development and paying for multiplayer servers. The problem now is that in order to fund the game we need to sell the characters. But by selling the characters you lower the amount of players you can get. So if we were to secure the funding we would develop the game fully and then make the characters free. That way there is automatically an incentive for people to join the ecosystem. And then we can overdeliver on their expectations out the gate. The rest of the money will be put to the side to keep the servers running for as long as we can. I think this is the best recipe for success.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/611/0
GG22,Allo Builders Advancement Round,ggframe,0x63b1EfC5602C0023BBb373F2350Cf34c2E5F8669,https://twitter.com/ggframe_xyz,https://github.com/gg-frame,ggframe,https://ggframe.xyz,APPROVED,"**ggframe is a public goods for public goods, a farcaster frame designed to make it easier for users to donate to the Gitcoin Grant.**
 
 Open Source Software (OSS) and public goods developers often face financial challenges because they are not associated with any specific country. This disconnect from national structures means they don't benefit from the redistribution mechanisms typically managed by governments. Consequently, these developers struggle to receive the financial rewards they deserve.
 
 Imagine a future where Gitcoin is seamlessly integrated with social media: developers of OSS and public goods can use ggframe to encourage users to donate without leaving their social media platforms. 
 
 Users simply discover ggframe, enter their donation amount, click a button, and complete their donation, significantly improving the user experience (UX).
 
 Currently, platforms like Twitter are used for promoting donations. With ggframe, donations can be solicited directly on social media channels.
 
 ggframe allows users to donate directly to Gitcoin Grants on Farcaster-supported chains such as Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism without leaving the app. Originally, users had to donate through explore.gitcoin.co, but ggframe directly interacts with the [Allo V2 contract](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2) used by Gitcoin Grants, ensuring secure and easy donations!
 
 ## Our Roadmap
 ggframe will operate as Open Source Software (OSS) and a public good to further encourage funding for public goods. By leveraging the Gitcoin platform, our goal is to facilitate the funding of millions to tens of millions of dollars for OSS and public goods through ggframe in the future.

GG22,ENS Ecosystem,Eppie: the web3-native email,0x26938B1A8f0B70e78a9FE03810eddeb03E4D1fE3,https://twitter.com/EppieApp,https://github.com/Eppie-io,Eppie: the web3-native email,https://eppie.io,APPROVED,"tl;dr Eppie is a community-powered providerless email. Check out our repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/Eppie-io). Public Alphas of both GUI and CLI aplications are available for testing. By the way, we have a soft spot for stars ‚≠ê on GitHub üòÅ
 
 
 [Download GUI client](https://github.com/Eppie-io/Eppie-App#install-from-microsoft-store-app-store-or-google-play) | [Download CLI](https://github.com/Eppie-io/Eppie-CLI#downloads) | [Subscribe](https://eppie.io/)
 
 
 ## The Big Picture ü¶Ñ
 
 Our mission is to take private data away from the servers of the Big Tech and allow users to be independent owners of their identities. We believe that decentralized trustless networks are ready to bring freedom and justice to the Internet. For everyone, not just a few advanced crypto enthusiasts. But first, Web3 needs some more every-day utility. _Like an email_.
 
 ## Here Comes The Communityüéâ
 
 A conventional email has a server. It ""provides the service"" to the users and, along the way, takes full control over their accounts and data. 
 
 Eppie is nothing like that. It operates entirely in a p2p network, where users provide the service to each other. Your messages are encrypted, delivered, and stored by the combined efforts of every user in the system. Why is it better? Your email finally belongs to you.
 
 - Nobody can access it
 - Nobody can prevent you from using it
 - And it is protected ‚Äî not by one server, but by millions of other users machines
 
 With all that said, Eppie is simple, beautiful, easy to set up and use: accept your seed phrase and you are all set. It is compatible with other DID standards and can send messages within Eppie‚Äôs own network or directly to any crypto wallet. Eppie integrages ENS which allows direct communication between ENS addresses *_and_* recieving normal Web2 emails to ENS address.
 
 The client application is also compatible with normal email, so you can keep using you Gmail or Microsoft Outlook along with the decentralized mailbox.

 Create an Eppie account by accepting your Seed Phrase.
 
 ![image](http://finebits.com/apps/eppie/eppie1.png)
 Start decentralized messaging like it‚Äôs a normal email.
 
 ![image](http://finebits.com/apps/eppie/eppie2.png)
 Connect your existing mailboxes and crypto wallets. Make them public or make them invisible at will.
 
 ## Features
 
 - üåé Works on all platforms: Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, Android
 - üï∂Ô∏è Privacy-first: there's no such thing as optional encryption
 - üöÄ P2P messaging: without servers nobody's holding your hand anymore
 - üîë Identity manager: key management is a breeze
 - üíæ Decentralized backup: your data is safe and only yours
 - ü§ô Ultimate interoperaility: Eppie can communicate with Ethereum, Bitcoin and more
 - üì¨ IMAP/SMTP compatible: connect to Gmail, Microsoft Outlook etc.
 - ü¶Ñ Proton Mail Authentication: Eppie is the first native desktop client capable of that
 - üîê PGP encryption: stay safe even with conventional email
 
 NOTE: the project is early in development, not all of the features are publicly availabe
 
 ## Fun fact üëÄ
 
 Eppie can use conventional email as a name service: so you send a message to Gmail address, but it never lands on the server and goes straight to the decentralized network.
 
 
 ## The Team ü§ì üòæ ü•≥
 
 We are 10 nerds with a passion for decentralized web. Our company is based in Estonia ‚Äî it is one of the best countries in Europe for Web3 project development in terms of legislation. We have been building multi-platform applications for more than 10 years. Our previously released products have 20 million downloads worldwide. Among other things, our programmers are involved in development of [**Beam**](~https://beam.mw/~) ‚Äî confidential cryptocurrency and DeFi platform.
 
 ![image](http://finebits.com/apps/eppie/team.png)
 
 
 ## Why You Need Another Email? üì¨
 
 Your mailbox probably stores all sorts of important information ‚Äî on your business and social activity, financial state, health, consumer behavior etc. You might even be using it as an identity provider to log into some crypto exchange and dozens of other services. Email is the core of your digital identity. 
 
 Yet, of 4+ billion email accounts in the world, about 0 belong to users. You log in ‚Äî _the server decides whether to allow you to use your identity or not_. This is a privacy violation by design. Identity naturally belongs to human, it should not be a service.
 
 * Own your messages at all times
  With a decentralized network you never have to trust a server to deliver your message. You create it, you own it. This is guaranteed by the whole community
 
 * Exchange messages with Gmail and Ethereum network
  Eppie will be compatible with conventional email and Ethereum addresses at launch, with many more to come. Switch to Web3 ‚Äî stay connected to everyone.
 
 * Don‚Äôt manage keys, manage contacts
  In Eppie identity management finally makes sense: create an identity card, choose people to share it with ‚Äî so they can message you, not your hash.
 
 * Move your old mailbox to Web3
  Any mailbox including Gmail. Emails and contacts. Make your data truly private by moving it to a decentralized network.
 
 
 ## How Does It Work? ‚öôÔ∏è
 
 The client application encrypts the data, breaks it to pieces and stores them on random nodes of the network ‚Äî the other client machines. The address is also a public key. Only the user can retrieve the data using their matching private key. No one else has access to it, including us, the developers. 
 
 And no one has the authority to allow or disallow a user into their account. The decision is made on your machine, locally. _Whoever owns the key, owns the mailbox_.
 
 
 ## Project Updates üèó
 
 ![image](http://finebits.com/apps/eppie/eppie4.jpg)
 
 We have finally made Eppie public! It is still in Alpha and the decentralized messaging only works in a test network. But you can try it anyway, both GUI and CLI applications.
 
 [Here](https://github.com/Eppie-io/Eppie-App) is a GUI app.
 
 And [this](https://github.com/Eppie-io/Eppie-CLI) is a CLI client for you, terminal lovers ‚ù§Ô∏è
 
 Also, we are still improving ProtonMail integration: Eppie is the first native desktop client capable of authenticating at **ProtonMail**, the largest title on privacy-first conventional email market.

GG22,Allo Builders Advancement Round,Giveth,0x01d1909cA27E364904934849eab8399532dd5c8b,https://twitter.com/giveth,https://github.com/Giveth,Giveth,https://giveth.io,APPROVED,"Giveth is onboarding real-world impact projects to web3 by empowering them with free access to novel fundraising mechanisms and new ecosystems of donors, while inspiring them to dive deeper down the blockchain rabbit hole.
 
 We‚Äôve been making HUGE progress so far in 2024: 
 
 Since August, we‚Äôve ran 2 quadratic funding rounds (making it a total of 8 QF rounds this year,) brought our donation platform to support 11 chains and networks now, launched the first iteration of our decentralized project verification system (using Devouch), and announced the first cohort of the Quadratic Accelerator (q/acc). q/acc is the precursor to ‚ÄúGurves‚Äù and is bringing us one step closer to [the holy grail of the Giveth roadmap](https://blog.giveth.io/the-power-of-giv-reimagining-public-goods-funding-1c5ab2a867e9) - making nonprofits profitable.
 
 
 [Giveth.io](https://giveth.io/) is an open source, radically transparent, user-friendly donation platform that allows anyone to open crypto funding portals by creating projects for positive impact, with zero added fees and no intermediaries. Donors are also rewarded for giving to a wide range of projects that cover the field of for-good ventures such as feeding the homeless, funding community currency projects, and promoting planetary well-being.
 
 Currently Giveth is live on Ethereum Mainnet, Gnosis Chain, Polygon PoS, OP Mainnet, Base, Polygon zkEVM, Celo, Ethereum Classic, Solana, Stellar, and Arbitrum.
 
 ## How it works
 
 Giveth goes beyond ‚Äújust donations‚Äù with the following features:
 
 * GIVbacks - Donors who give to verified public goods projects get rewarded with GIV. This flips the script on tax-deductible donation, creating a decentralized and borderless way of incentivizing donations.
 * GIVpower - Donors can lock their GIV tokens for GIVpower and use them to boost/curate projects on the platform. Projects with more GIVpower are ranked higher, and in turn, their donors are rewarded with more GIVbacks, similar to the veToken model. Top-boosted projects also appear higher on Giveth!
 * Quadratic Funding - The democratic matching program popularized by Gitcoin is also available on Giveth! Projects and donors enjoy multi-chain donation rounds with an easy and streamlined user experience.
 
 ## Who uses it
 
 Currently, over 5,800 projects have raised donations from over 17,800 donor addresses on Giveth.
 
 Projects who want to get to the next level can apply to be ‚ÄúVerified‚Äù as a public goods creator, providing information about their impact history and reputation at stake.
 
 ## Updates
 
 As we continue along into the final quarter of 2024, we are excited to announce some significant updates and future plans.
 
 ### Major milestones achieved last quarter
 
 * Ran 2 successful quadratic funding rounds start-to-finish, raising $100,000 for projects on Giveth through the matching pools of the GIV-ARB and the GIV-a-Palooza rounds, plus an additional $44,000 from donations!
 * Closed a partnership with Endaoment and welcomed over 3,600 registered nonprofit projects into Giveth‚Äôs DApp.
 * Launched Devouch - a decentralized vouching mechanism that lets people mint attestations and lend their reputation to projects they support.
 * Launched phase 1 of our decentralized project verification system, leveraging Devouch to empower trusted community members to vouch for impact projects.
 * Ran a ‚ÄúRecurring Donation Rally‚Äù, encouraging Giveth donors to set up donation streams.
 * Added support for Coinbase and Trust Wallet on Mobile & Desktop
 * Added stellar as an option for donating & fundraising in QF rounds and beyond.
 * Brought the GIVeconony to Polygon zkEVM, adding support for GIV staking, GIVbacks and GIVpower.

 ### Upcoming Goals - In Progress
 
 The following is a list of products and features that we are currently working on building: 
 
 * Improving QF round matching estimations, making use of COCM, to more accurately convey the impact of a particular donation on the matching funds.
 * Launch Season 3 of our Ambassador Program to empower a broader group of Giveth users.
 * Iterate upon our GIVbacks donor rewards program using a raffle system designed to encourage larger donations to verified public goods projects.
 * Expand our [GIVeconomy dune dashboard](https://dune.com/giveconomy/giveconomy) to include Polygon zkEVM, offering useful stats and information regarding GIV.
 * Create the MVP spec for Gurves (estimated to launch in 2025), to enable public goods projects to launch micro-economies backed by GIV.
 * Run the 1st q/acc round with a cohort of projects building on Polygon, enabling them to launch new token economies through a novel mechanism that combines QF and augmented bonding curves.
 
 ### Upcoming Goals - Under Research
 
 The following is a list of new products, partnerships, and features that we are considering adding to our roadmap near and long term. Our ability to execute on these goals is dependent on fundraising and the success of our economy, so if you want to support the Future of Giving, please add us to your cart and donate!
 
 * Bitcoin: Integrate Bitcoin to allow donors and projects to use Bitcoin for crowdfunding - enabling access to new audiences holding 56% of the total crypto market cap.
 * Donation Handler Smart Contract: Build infrastructure so that all donations pass through smart contracts, enabling custom logic to be added on top of donations made on Giveth in an on-chain and transparent way. 
 * GIVeconomy UX: Improve the UX design of the GIVeconomy to make it easier for users to understand project curation & donor rewards.
 * Recurring Donations UX: improve the design of recurring (streaming) donations to make it easier for donors to ‚Äúset it and forget it‚Äù.

Currently, with 800K unique participants holding ENS names, only 22,500 of them have active dwebsites. which points to the challenges users face in deploying and designing their dwebsites. Our approach is focused on transforming ENS domains into foundational building blocks for decentralised identities (DIDs), where each domain is connected to a content hash, revealing a unique digital persona.
 
 Over the past year, our focus has been the simplification of 'link-in-bio' pages, making it possible for users to connect their ENS domains with personalised and informative dwebsite that serves as a central hub for their decentralised identity (DID). Building upon this foundation, we are expanding our scope to include comprehensive blogging tools, static sites and customizable templates.
 
 
 **Over the last year, we've launched a suite of essential tools and platforms for the ENS community,**
 * Webhash (webhash.com): An innovative no-code platform enabling ENS domain owners to easily create decentralized websites (Dwebsites) without technical know-how. This tool democratizes access to the decentralized web by simplifying the process of building and deploying Dwebsites.
  
  We have conducted two buildathons to motivate ENS holders to create decentralized websites (dWebsites) for .eth domains, distributing prizes totaling around $2200 among the competition winners. More buildations are coming soon.
 
 
 **Stats**
 We‚Äôve achieved notable success with over 2600 user signups and the creation of more than 5000 decentralised ‚Äòlink-in-bio‚Äô websites with 300GB IPFS decentralised storage utilisation.
 
  New blocks we are developing to integrate into dwebsites
  * **Farcaster Block**: Enables the integration of Farcaster feeds into an ENS dWebsite, allowing users to display their Farcaster social media content.
 
 * **Lens Block**: Facilitates the addition of Lens platform feeds to an ENS dWebsite, offering a seamless way to showcase social interactions.
 
 * **POAP Block**: Allows for the display of POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) collections on an ENS dWebsite, highlighting user participation and achievements.
 
 * **Crypto Payment Block**: Empowers .eth domain holders to accept cryptocurrency payments directly through their dWebsite, streamlining the transaction process.
 
 
 **Static sites:**
 Using WebHash, will support a range of static websites, from professional portfolios, and resumes to business landing pages, interactive forms, and marketing lead generation pages. These static sites will be optimised for performance, accessibility, and search engine visibility which are key factors for widespread adoption and utility of dwebsites.
 
 **Customisable templates:**
 Expanding upon our vision, WebHash is also dedicated to providing a diverse array of aesthetically pleasing and customizable templates. These templates are designed to cater to a wide range of needs and styles, ensuring that each dwebsite can reflect the unique identity and purpose of its owner. From sleek and professional to vibrant and creative, our templates offer the flexibility and variety necessary for users to create a dwebsite that resonates with their personal brand or business ethos.
 
 In addition to these, we are continuously exploring new opportunities within the ENS ecosystem. 
 
 
 **Achievements:**
 
 1. No-Code Interface: We've created a no-code, user-friendly interface that makes building dwebsites accessible to everyone, regardless of technical expertise.
 
 2. Versatile Content Creation & Integration: Our platform at WebHash enriches the ENS domain experience by enabling users to create a broad spectrum of content types with seamless integrations. We have designed a user-friendly interface that allows for the addition of various standard elements such as avatars with diverse styles, engaging headings, informative paragraphs, and external links, all of which enhance the user's webpage. The integration capabilities of our platform include a suite of options that cater to different media types and functionalities:
 
 * Social Media Integration: Users can showcase their social presence with icons linked to their profiles on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and more, fostering engagement directly from their ENS dwebsite.
 * Multimedia Content: Embedding capabilities for platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, Twitch, Spotify, and SoundCloud allow users to share a wide range of audiovisual content, from music tracks and podcasts to videos and livestreams.
 * Interactive Features: Inclusion of interactive elements such as image sliders, RSS feeds, countdown widgets, and forms elevates the user experience by engaging visitors with dynamic content.
 * Content Distribution: Our platform supports file sharing directly from the page, whether it‚Äôs audio files, PDF documents, or any downloadable content, making it a versatile tool for content distribution.
 * Communication and Sharing: Integration of communication tools like Discord servers and call-to-action prompts encourages community building and interaction. Additionally, our VCard feature enables users to share contact information in a professional manner.
 * Monetization: We've integrated payment solutions like PayPal, enabling users to collect payments for products, services, or donations directly through their ENS dwebsite.
 * Customization: Advanced customization with custom HTML/CSS/JS and Markdown formatting allows for unique content creation.
 * Credibility and Engagement: By adding customer reviews and FAQs, users can build credibility and provide valuable information to their audience.
 
 The combination of these features on the WebHash platform not only empowers users to create comprehensive 'link-in-bio' pages but also extends to more complex dwebsite formats such as blogs, portfolios, and business landing pages. Each feature is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, ensuring that even those with no coding skills can build a professional and aesthetically pleasing online presence on the decentralised web.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/642/1
GG22,GG22 OSS - dApps and Apps,Abundance Protocol,0xc6FD734790E83820e311211B6d9A682BCa4ac97b,https://twitter.com/Abundance_DAO,https://github.com/abundance-protocol,Abundance Protocol,https://abundance.id,APPROVED,"Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if anyone could make a living simply by creating impact in their community and in the world? Even better, if their profit equaled to their impact? That is what Abundance Protocol is building towards. Such a vision seems far off into the future, but we believe it is within reach.
 
 To achieve that we are building a Public Goods Funding mechanism that is based on Value Consensus. What is Value Consensus? The most effective mechanism in crypto for funding public goods right now is the Consensus Mechanism - over $1T in value distributed to miners/stakers who provide the common good of network security to the network.
 
 So what if we took this powerful mechanism and expanded it to all types of common and public good? If the community could come to consensus on what it valued and therefore could credibly determine the impact of public goods for the community? (see whitepaper: https://whitepaper.abundance.id)
 
 This year we released The Abundance Economy book, outlining the vision of an economy where people can thrive by creating impact. It is available as a public good (aka for free) at https://book.abundance.id
 
 We are now in the early stages of developing the Impact App (https://impact.abundance.id) - a Farcaster client that aims to leverage network effects (and the wealth of data from the open social graph) to allow any community and ecosystem fund what matters to them. It would also allow anyone to focus on impact creation and be rewarded seamlessly through social media tools they already use daily.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/608/10

 We are a public goods data platform designed specifically for Ethereum scaling solutions to analyze fundamentals as well as more detailed blockspace usage with a curated set of categories. 
 
 Our goal is to empower builders and users alike by providing them with a comprehensive overview of fundamental metrics, onchain data, and educational resources, to help them make informed decisions when selecting their chain to build and interact on. 
 
 We believe that real-world impact can only be achieved when people can select and use projects that fulfil their actual needs and when they know what‚Äôs out there. We achieve this through better transparency and overview of what‚Äôs happening in the Ethereum ecosystem.
 
 The platform is and will stay free to use, striving to improve everyday through better UX and meaningful data. We do not have any VC funding or angel investment, nor do we have any subscription fee to access more data by individual users. All data can be seen and used (also via our API) free of charge. We are also completely open-source.
 
 We also label smart contracts on Layer 2s, allowing tagging of usage type based on the Open Labels Initiative standard, which we co-founded are actively developing. 
 
 ![growthepie Landing Page](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-landingpage.gif ""growthepie Landing Page"")
 
 ## In short
 
 Platform Capabilities:
 
 - Fundamental Metrics and Chain Comparisons: We provide key metrics categorized into Activity, Value Locked, and Convenience.
 - Economics view: We have a dedicated economics page to compare chains and their economic data, like revenue, cost, profit and margins.
 - Blockspace Explorer: This tool offers a detailed overview of blockspace usage across different Layer 2 chains showing how each chain is being used.
 - Smart Contract Label Overview & Suggestions: Users can view and suggest smart contract labels, contributing to the platform's community-driven aspect.
 - Single Chain Metrics: Comprehensive, chain-specific pages that showcase all metrics for a particular chain.
 - Public Goods Trackers: We develop and maintain several public goods trackers, like Optimism RetroFunding, Octant Epochs, and Glo Dollar holdings.
 
 ## Our goals and usage of funds üöÄ
 
 - Application-specific analytics: We want to go one level deeper and enable users to analyze individual projects (labeled smart contracts) in much more detail, for example their traction on different Layer 2s, fees of using them on either, etc.
 
 - More detailed transaction fees page: We are building on our most popular metric, and enhancing the data and transparency for our users by providing more detailed fees for transacting on the listed Layer 2s
 
 - More convenient analytics and sharing features: We continue to improve the UX to enable better analytics of metrics and chains, comparisons and also sharing of charts and tables for your own usage
 
 - Enhancing data with knowledge snippets: Tied with our metrics, we provide content for both developers and consumers to understand data and their specific use cases more. Also, what each of the events readable from data means for a specific Layer 2 and what this means compared to other L2 chains. Additional educational content for each metric brings data-based decision-making closer to each end-user/developer/investor.
 
 - Development of more impact trackers: We are working on enhancing our RPGF3 Tracker, and enable the same and better information overview for other impact projects. This development is in the early stages but fits our goal to provide better metrics and usability around data, as a public goods funded project.
 
 - Cross-reference applications/projects with their impact and funding: Since we are a public good and have lots of valuable data on projects (see goal above in this list), we aim to provide more visualizations and trackers on projects and their impact on users and the ecosystem in general. This can include OP RPGF, Gitcoin, Octant and other platforms providing data for us to visualize
 
 - Addition of more current and upcoming chains in the Ethereum ecosystem
 
 - Changing and maintaining infrastructure, adapting our Blockspace Explorer to Open Labels Initiative's data standard once the first version is defined
 
 
 ## What can you do on our platform currently? üßê
 
 Currently, we provide a curated and easy-to-understand set of metrics for Layer 2s, focusing on 21 chains: Arbitrum One, Base, Blast, Derive, OP Mainnet, Orderly, Immutable X, Linea, Loopring, Manta Pacific, Mantle, Metis, Mode, Polygon zkEVM, Redstone, rhino, Scroll, Starknet, Taiko, zkSync Era and Zora. All data has been pulled via RPC, some has been received from data providers or is linked to other sources. However, we are changing more and more to connecting our own RPC for better data quality and reliability.
 
 
 ### Fundamental metrics Analysis
 
 **Activity**
 
 - Daily Active Addresses: The number of unique daily addresses that interacted with a chain.
 
 - Transaction Count: The number of daily transactions. We try to only count transactions that are executed by users/smart contracts, excluding system transactions.
 
 - Throughput: The number of daily transactions. We try to only count transactions that are executed by users/smart contracts - no system transactions.
 
 **Value Locked**
 
 - Stablecoin Market Cap: The sum of stablecoins that are locked on the chain.
 
 - Total Value Locked: The sum of all funds locked on the chain.
 
 **Convenience**
 
 - Transaction Costs: The median amount that is paid per transaction.
 
 ### Economics page
 
 Our Economics Page provides a comprehensive overview including table and historic charts of key financial metrics for all supported chains, including revenue, costs, profit, and margin. This allows users to gauge the economic health of the chain.
 
 **Individual Metrics**
 
 - Fees Paid by Users: The sum of fees that were paid by users of the chain in gas fees or, in the case of chains like Immutable X, the amount of fees that were paid to the protocol wallet.
 
 - Rent Paid to L1: The gas fees paid by L2s to post transaction data & verification states onto Ethereum.
 
 - Onchain Profit: The net profit of L2s, accounting for revenues as L2 gas fees collected and expenses as posting transaction data & verification states onto Ethereum.
 
 - Fully Diluted Valuation: The theoretical market cap of a token if all its planned tokens (total supply) were issued at the current price.
 
 - Market Cap: The total value of all circulating tokens, calculated by multiplying the current price of a single token by the total number of tokens in circulation.

 ### fees.growthepie.xyz
 
 We also have a more detailed and realtime updating fees page: https://fees.growthepie.xyz - allowing to view median and average fees, swap fees, transfer fees, transaction per second, and throughput live. 
 
 ![growthepie Realtime Fees](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-fees.gif ""growthepie Realtime Fees"")
 
 
 ### Blockspace Explorer
 
 With one rollup launching after the other, it is hard for users to understand what‚Äôs going on in the Ethereum ecosystem. Helping to analyze blockspace changes this trajectory.
 
 ![growthepie Blockspace Explorer](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-blockspaceoverview.gif ""growthepie Blockspace Overview"")
 
 Our platform offers the following to Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem:
 
 - An overview of chains‚Äô high-level blockspace usage. All expressed in shares of a chain‚Äôs total blockspace. In simple words: For which purpose are these Layers 2s built and what do people do with them?
 
 - A comparison for available Layer 2s for their usage in specific categories, ranging from NFT, Token Transfers to Socials applications. For each of these and more categories, we have a set of subcategories that allow you to filter in more detail and compare which category is more used on which chain.
 
 - For each category/subcategory, users can see the most-used smart contracts ranked in a table and make sense of how the chain is being used
 
 ![growthepie Blockspace Comparison](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-blockspacecomparison.gif ""growthepie Blockspace Comparison"")
 
 
 ### Smart Contract Labeling based Open Labels Initiative (OLI) standard
 
 In order to ensure that people can make sense of all these Ethereum scaling solutions, we need to label smart contracts, i.e. projects that launch on the respective Layer 2s or Layer 3s. Currently, we label smart contracts ourselves. This is a huge effort, as every smart contract that is deployed needs to be researched, labeled, and verified. For this reason, we are building the Open Labels Initiative as one of the founding members, together with other contributors. This initiative aims to tackle the issue of isolated and non-standardized contract and wallet labeling datasets within the blockchain data community. By introducing a standardized data model for smart contract and wallet labels we advocate for the consolidation into a single, universally accessible data structure utilized by various data providers. Additionally, we also aim to function as an aggregator for labeling tools (i.e. automated ERC detection, activity tagging, etc.). All smart contracts that we labeled can be used by any third party for their own analysis or database. 
 
 
 ### labels.growthepie.xyz
 
 We recently launched our new labels page, dedicated to showcasing all labels on supported Layer 2 chains: https://labels.growthepie.xyz 
 
 ![growthepie Single Chain Metrics](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-labels.gif ""growthepie Labels"")
 
 Users have the ability to filter down by chain, categories, subcategories as well as individual projects and types of contracts. Sorting by Transaction Count, Activity, etc. can also help identify new and exciting contracts/projects as well.
 
 
 ### Smart Contract Label Suggestions
 
 On our main platform users can already participate! Suggest smart contract labels and become an essential part of the pie. We will work on this feature to enable more community-based and open-source smart contract labeling.
 
 
 ### Single Chain Metrics All-in-One
 
 You can compare chains amongst each other with all the metrics mentioned. Additionally, you have chain-specific pages that allow you to have a glance at all metrics for a chain at once.
 
 ![growthepie Single Chain Metrics](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-singlechain.gif ""growthepie Single Chain Metrics"")
 
 
 ### Retroactive Public Goods Fund Tracker
 
 In addition to aggregating data and providing fundamental metrics, we tracked projects and their impact for Optimism‚Äôs RPGF3 as well as Octant Epoch 3 & 4. This was the start of tracking impact for projects and providing transparency and overview of their achievements and previous funding.
 
 Additionally, we worked with Glo Dollar to design a tracker for the main platform to showcase the Glo Dollar holders and spread the word about the stablecoin that funds public goods.

GG22,Land Regenerators,Barichara Regeneration Fund ‚Äì Prototyping a Bioregional Regenerative Economy,0xFd9F8A0f4bdEaC72F08AF1c708023cC31dD2E3BE,https://twitter.com/cognitivepolicy,https://github.com/,Barichara Regeneration Fund ‚Äì Prototyping a Bioregional Regenerative Economy,https://www.regeneratebarichara.org,APPROVED,"About
 The Barichara Regeneration Fund (BRF) supports the wholesale restoration of a 500,000-hectare territory in the Northern Andes of Colombia by developing and weaving together a network of individuals and organizations pursuing regenerative work on the individual, social, and ecological scale. Money received will be utilized to continue the ongoing work of the BRF to catalyze on-the-ground regenerative work in Barichara in service to the creation of a prototype of a bioregional regenerative economy that can be utilized worldwide.
 
 Introduction
 The town of Barichara, Colombia is uniquely positioned to cultivate large-scale regenerative work. Situated on a plateau, Barichara is at the center of a 500,000 hectare territory defined by its own regional climate system. The region possesses an incredibly unique ecosystem, the High-Andes tropical dry forest, that exists nowhere else on Earth with eighty percent of the species here being endemic, only existing in this territory. Unfortunately, the region has also seen intense monocrop agriculture, leaving only ten percent of the native forests intact. This, in turn, has led to soil degradation and erosion, the drying up of rivers, and the loss of the unique biodiversity of the territory.
 
 What Has Been Accomplished 
 We successfully raised $21,000 in the previous gitcoin round (GR15), $14,000 in the alpha round, and $8,000 in the beta round. With these funds we have made considerable progress in setting up a territorial foundation capable to oversee this territorial-scale regenerative work while supporting all of the projects listed above. 
 
 Projects we are supporting include:
 
 1. The Center for Syntropic Agroforestry to establish demonstration sites, train local farmers, and share technical knowledge about this powerful approach to reforestation and economic development.
 
 2. A community kitchen and store called Casa Comun that prototypes alternative economic models and hosts local exchanges among more than 80 local producers in the community.
 
 3. A community reforestation project called Bioparque M√≥ncora that is a highly visible symbol of peace, reforestation, and ecological education that works with area schools and national universities.
 
 4. The construction of a community theater called Caney Colibri where children learn the art of storytelling, filmmaking, and the performing arts ‚Äì all in service to regeneration of the territory.
 
 5. The Origen del Agua Nature Reserve that is reforesting 3.2 hectares of heavily degraded land with native plant species while working with a local school to bring campesino children into the learning process.
 
 With funds that we raise during this gitcoin round, we will continue weaving this tapestry of local projects and sharing what we learn with the rest of the world through the Design School for Regenerating Earth and a variety of social media channels.
 
 Vision
 All the activities of the BRF are in service to the creation of a real-world prototype of a regenerative bioregional economy. By weaving those that are on the ground, purchasing strategic pieces of land, integrating Web3 tools to monitor change in ecological health, and being continually open to new collaborative relationships as they arrive, the BRF intends to lay the groundwork for others to follow in their own territories. We hope that with the success of this model in Barichara, it can be used as a prototype worldwide and help regenerate the planet through regenerating local communities.
 
 Learn More
 BRF community council member Joe Brewer has made the effort to document its progress to English speaking audiences. He has formulated his thoughts on the process in his book, The Design Pathway for Regenerating Earth, and founded the Earth Regenerators network, a diverse platform with over 4,000 participants dedicated to restoring planetary health, to spread the model developed here, while learning from others‚Äô experiences. He is also co-founder alongside Penny Heiple and Benji Ross of the Design School for Regenerating Earth.

Our mission is to regenerate the regional climate system of our territory in the heart of the Northern Andes. This includes three major river systems and a unique ecology like nowhere else on Earth ‚Äì the ‚ÄúHigh Andes Tropical Dry Forest‚Äù that has been severely damaged in the last 80 years.
 
 Our team is comprised of community leaders who work in one or more of four thematic areas:
 
 1. Regenerative Education
 2. Regeneration of Natural Ecosystems
 3. Regenerative Economy
 4. Cultural Regeneration and Territorial Healing
 
 A major focus for us is watershed restoration through land-system change. We live in a region that is rapidly becoming a desert after more than 95% of the tropical dry forest was cut down in order to produce monoculture crops, introduce cattle and real estate development. We weave among local initiatives to organize at landscape scales using techniques from permaculture, Syntropic agroforestry, and other domains of relevant knowledge.
 
 We also gather and convene local producers of food, cosmetics, natural fibers, earthen construction, and related craft skills to create regenerative economic models through an initiative called Casa Com√∫n. Barichara is registered as a national heritage site in Colombia for its depths of local cultural craft skills among the descendants of the Indigenous Guane people and local campesinos that go by the name Patiamarillos.
 
 We believe that regeneration at all the levels mentioned can only be possible if there is a spiritual and emotional healing at the individual and collective level, through the restoration of the human relationships and also through our relation with Planet Earth and all of its earthlings. 
 
 In order to help organize all of this work, we have established our own territorial foundation called Barichara Regenerativa and are in the process of creating four different community-led funding ecosystems. They are a Regenerative Education Fund, Restoring the Rivers Fund, Regenerative Economics Fund, and Territorial Healing Fund. In the last four years, we have mobilized several hundred thousand dollars through various philanthropic relationships and in numerous Gitcoin rounds. The funding has always come into community hands through processes of sociocratic decision-making.
 
 Our focus for the funding that we receive in this BioFi Pathfinders Round is to support the creation of governance structures for watershed restoration while weaving among reforestation efforts that are already underway throughout our territory. This is part of the Restoring the Rivers Fund that has been in a process of gradual formation throughout the last year. It is connected with work that we are doing to create a Geoportal of geographic information systems that connect different educational initiatives and watershed restoration efforts across our territory.
 
 Our team at the foundation has the following founding members:

The Accelerator uses the q/acc protocol, which combines the power of Quadratic Funding (QF) with the advantages of Augmented Bonding Curves (ABC) to bootstrap and scale token economies with community at their center. This protocol drives long-term value and alignment across protocols, projects, and communities. In addition to a clear tokenization strategy, projects benefit from grants that scale their token economies.
 
 Each season accepts up to 10 projects into our 10-week program. During that time projects will launch their token economy via ABC, invite KOL, contributors and others to have priority access to the team and token, and join their first q/acc round where supporters receive tokens at the end of the round, and the quadratic matching funds will build secondary market liquidity for projects.
 
 After completing a season, projects may participate in all future q/acc rounds.
 
 The q/acc is designed to:
 - Makes early funding rounds open and accessible to all, not just VCs
 - Rewards supporters with privileged access and token upside 
 - Aligns incentives between protocols, projects and community
 - Drives long-term adoption for protocols",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/608/105

 # Why Donate to Goalz
 Hello Gitcoin, 
 
 Thank you for having Goalz in the Hackathon Alumni Round in GG20. Since receiving the grant, we have been able to deploy on both Arbitrum and Base networks. Additionally, we have completed integrations with Gelato for automation and Aave for yield. We have also embraced Karma GAP as my main tool for setting milestones and tracking updates for Goalz. 
 
 There are not many savings applications in the space, but we think savings applications will help onboard new people. Attractive DeFi yields bring in new people. Goalz gives new people a non-speculative place to participate. Furthermore, existing heavy crypto users that hold balances of USDC, DAI, or whatever token can benefit a lot from having a tool that periodically, automatically pulls a small amount out of their wallet and puts it towards a premeditated financial goal, such as saving for airfare and hotel for the next ETH conference.
 
 Please consider supporting our project even with the smallest of donations! Your support has a major impact.
 
 Sincerely, 
 Mike Ghen

 # Goalz: Decentralized Savings Goals App üè¶üí°
 
 ## Problem: Saving is hard
 Saving money for essential goals and aspirations can be challenging. Many people struggle to set aside funds for purchases or future objectives. They often resort to credit-based solutions that lead to debt.
 
 ## Existing Solutions Limitations:
 The first limitation of the traditional finance implementation is that savings accounts today have maintenance fees. Another challenge is having just one savings account makes it difficult to track saving for multiple goals at the same time. Intuit‚Äôs Mint is limited in this way and requires you to open a new account for each goal.
 
 Furthermore, both the automation options and the assets available to use for savings are limited. The yields will always be low due to the overhead that custodial banking services pass onto the consumer. There is a lack of integration between the banking features and the goal setting features that makes it difficult to use. The few integrated options are limited in the geography they can serve.
 
 ## Solution: Blockchain-based Savings Accounts
 Goalz uses DeFi technology to address these problems. Goalz allows users to create many accounts for each of their goals. This lets you track progress towards specific objectives rather than tracking all your savings in one account. It also supports automated deposits and other programmability. Goalz can support a variety of digital assets including yield bearing assets like staked ETH. Goalz integrates the banking features with the goal tracking features into a single application. Goalz is also globally available to everyone thanks to blockchain technology.
 
 ## Why is Goalz the Right Solution?
 The limitations of the traditional finance way of doing this are that you (1) need to open an account for each of your goals and (2) you must set up the automation on your own with your bank which might not support the automation.
 
 The features of the Ethereum blockchain are put to full use with Goalz Savings app. Each goal can be its own account with its own asset to use for saving (e.g. cbETH or aUSDC). Deposits can be automated using smart contracts like Gelato. There is no limitation on the number of accounts, no overhead to open an account, and the accounts themselves can be fully automated in ways that no traditional bank account can be. Additionally, Goalz is built on the Base public blockchain which means it's available globally.
 
 ## How it's Made
 This project is built for the Base blockchain using Solidity with Hardhat on the backend. The iMuzz/web3-starter using React with Wagmi and Rainbowkit was used to build the frontend. The project used Tenderly for simulations and debugging and was deploy to the Base Goerli blockchain. Visual studio code was the IDE used and the code was version controlled with Github.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/608/106

GG22,GG22 OSS - dApps and Apps,Event Horizon,0xE67192302E444a8D28F60F6737a8bc7c672b8aC6,https://twitter.com/EventHorizonDAO,https://github.com/HVAX,Event Horizon,https://EventHorizon.vote,APPROVED,"**Event Horizon is a public good, public-access metagovernance pool...** designed to enfranchise the long tail distribution of tens of thousands of smaller voters found within the citizenry of every DAO.
 
 **Metrics & Traction:** Event Horizon is already live within both the Gitcoin and Arbitrum ecosystems and has mobilized >$60,000,000 of voting power across ~400 proposals on over 6 DAOs all on behalf of retail voters at no cost to the user. This is $60,000,000 of voice amplification for the low-capital, high-conviction citizens which would never have been possible prior to the Event Horizon's product. 
 
 Most recently, Event Horizon officially partnered with Gitcoin to leverage the Gitcoin Passport and received a 150,000 GTC community delegation:
 
  [Announcement Tweet](https://x.com/EventHorizonDAO/status/1773075757759127818?s=20 )
 
 Event Horizon is in the process of conducting a similar proposal, inclusive of Gitcoin's Passport solution, for the Arbitrum community: 
 
 [Arbitrum Proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-to-a-public-access-public-good-citizen-enfranchisement-pool-through-event-horizon/21523)
 
 # More Information:
 **Most DAOs face a problem:** Not enough people care to vote, and those who do care don‚Äôt have much influence. Today, typical DAO voter and token participation hovers around 1%. That means 99% of a DAO's governance thought capital is not being used to improve the DAO's collective cognition. Voting when you only have, say, $100 worth of voting power, simply doesn‚Äôt make sense, it‚Äôs a drop in the bucket. Sitting out governance proposals is, unfortunately, the rational decision but collectively makes everyone worse off. However, given that the strength of the DAO is directly related to the number of participants having their voices heard by the community, this problem needs to be addressed.
 
 **Solution:** Voting is the first step to onboarding new DAO contributors and/or delegates. But without meaningful voting authority, new and existing DAO citizens will remain sidelined and the DAO will remain worse off compared to competitors who optimize top of funnel. 
 
 Event Horizon allows DAO citizens to vote with meaningful authority though is novel governance mechanism: [Implicit Delegation](https://medium.com/hvax/implicit-delegation-event-horizons-governance-solution-3815d61ded12) 
 
 Event Horizon slots into the broader DAO ecosystem in a similar fashion to a standard delegate. However, rather than the pool voting based on the decision of one individual or group, it votes with the collective cognition of hundreds of individual Event Horizon Voter Pass holders. This serves two functions:
 
 1. **Enfranchise Community Citizens:** It provides a clear and designated voice for smaller, retail voters.
 
 2. **Increase Meaningful Retail Participation:** It drives participation through a game theoretic process called Implicit Delegation. Whether 10 people show up to vote, or 10,000 people do, the full retail voter allotment is mobilized in support of the community‚Äôs desired outcome:
 
 *When participation is low‚Ä¶* each voter receives a larger slice of the public access pie. This means the fewer people there are voting, the more incentive there is for someone new to come and participate.
 
 *When participation is high‚Ä¶* there are more voters splitting the same pie, however, retail participation is high, which is a great win for the ecosystem.
 
 This is all done without the need to pay delegates with inflationary token rewards, which would attract the wrong crowd anyway. Event Horizon‚Äôs model attracts people strictly interested in governance, not payment.
 
 **DAO Benefits:** From a DAO perspective, Implicit Delegation brings the many great ideas and voices from the long-tail distribution of low-capital community members to the surface. We like to say that the best ideas in an ecosystem are often held in the minds of individuals with $50 in governance voice, so we need a better platform for these ideas to be heard.
 
 
 **Delegate Benefits:** Governance is hard. It is nearly impossible to review, react to, and care about every individual proposal. EH functions as a hive mind to solve this problem. If there are 3 proposals (Gaming, Lending, and Partnership) 100 citizens may show up to vote for each, but the exact voter body may be entirely different each time, with those caring about gaming participating in the gaming proposal, and so on and so forth for the other proposal topics.
 
 # How it Works:
 
 | **Step 0 ‚Äì Mint:** Any citizen of the DAO ecosystem may [mint](https://eventhorizon.vote/mint) a free voter pass.
 
 | **Step 1 ‚Äì Duplication:** Once a delegation is established, Event Horizon begins automatically duplicating all base DAO proposals within its own [metagovernance dashboard](https://eventhorizon.vote/vote).
 
 | **Step 2 ‚Äì Metagovernance:** Retail voters may mint a free voter pass and begin voting to decide how the retail enfranchisement pool is mobilized in the base DAO proposal.
 
 | **Step 3 ‚Äì Base DAO Voting:** 24 hours prior to the closure of the base DAO proposal, the Event Horizon metagovernance proposal closes. Event Horizon then automatically pushes the consensus decision established by the retail community during the metagovernance proposal into the base DAO proposal.
 
 The end result is, **Citizens who vote through Event Horizon vote with a significant vote multiple**. We've often seen multiples upwards of 10,000x and roughly $40k voting power per voter. This provides new users a strong incentive to show up and vote.
 
 ## Voter fatigue and self-selection
 Implicit Delegation has other elegant benefits. 
 
 Voter fatigue is a well-known problem for delegates. It's a lot of work to carefully parse every new proposal, track the continuously evolving discussion, follow every iteration, and then express a well-written opinion on the matter when it comes time to vote. Add to the mix that many delegates are delegates on multiple DAOs and voter fatigue becomes quite understandable. 
 
 *Given that Implicit Delegation's sole incentive is governance authority, it attracts people not interested in capital, but in governance*. So our model self-selects for governance nerds. 
 
 But there's an additional layer to this. Given the only incentive is governance authority, *Event Horizon voters only vote on what they have strong opinions on*. If there's a DeFi proposal, DeFi nerds come out of the woodwork. If there's a gaming proposal put up to Snapshot, then only the gaming nerds show up to vote. But the block is fully utilized every time. This ensures that we have 100% token participation every time, driven entirely by those underrepresented Citizens most interested in *this particular proposal*. This minimizes voter fatigue and rewards those who care most.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/608/11
GG22,GG22 OSS - Developer Tooling and Libraries,Bonding Curve Research Group (BCRG),0x29567BdBcC92aCF37AC6B56B69180857bB69f7D1,https://twitter.com/Bonding_Curves,https://github.com/bonding-curves,Bonding Curve Research Group (BCRG),https://bonding-curve-research-group.gitbook.io/bonding-curve-research-group-library,APPROVED,"‚öîÔ∏è The Challenge:
 In the early days of crypto and ICOs, many projects and DAOs launched static supply tokens which struggled to expand and contract with bull and bear market swings, and are not adaptive enough for the dynamic nature of these nascent economies.
 
 This has also been a huge challenge for token valuations, with many DAOs and organizations seeing massive selloffs and price drops in the 90%+ range. When token price is a primary driver of the capacity to carry out work in a DAO ecosystem, volatile token prices are a hindrance to production in Web3 organizations.
 
 Many DAOs and organizations are looking to move from static supply to dynamic issuance models and reduce volatility, however, many of these economic mechanisms and markets remain untested, and the designs need to be further studied and validated, in order to deploy safe and sustainable economies.
 
 ‚§¥Ô∏è Overview of Bonding Curves:
 Bonding curves are an interesting new tool in the Web3 space that tie two or more elements of a system together through mathematical relationships encoded into smart contracts. Bonding Curves are a ‚Äòsupply discovery‚Äô mechanism that allows new tokens to be minted (or burned) by the deposit (or withdrawal) of reserve assets when the demand for new tokens is greater (or less) than the available supply. Also called automated market makers (AMMs), there are different types of bonding curves, including but not limited to constant product, constant function, concentrated liquidity, variable product, time-weighted, and even order book-based bonding curves. 
 
 Bonding curves have also been ‚Äòaugmented‚Äô with the addition of common pool treasuries or even prediction markets, in order to improve the collective signaling capacity of these new tools for social and ecosystemic benefit.
 
 This is just the beginning of their utility, and current tools have only taken the first steps to explore this design space. Bonding Curves are a gateway for engineered control systems to facilitate and improve the economic management and value accrual systems of Web3.

 üö¶The Opportunity:
 Bonding Curves provide an economic invariant between the supply of tokens and the reserve assets backing their value, making token price deterministic and providing guaranteed liquidity for tokens. Adjusting the circulating supply based on demand dampens the volatility and couples with the demand for the token‚Äôs utility. 
 
 Using bonding curves as a continuous token issuance mechanism, organizations or communities can leverage algorithmic reserve and liquidity management strategies to provide volatility-damped token price fluctuations. The Token Engineering Commons Augmented Bonding Curve is a prime example of this, outperforming ETH through the bear market. Other blockchain ecosystems could employ these mechanisms to support their token economies‚Äô success. 
 
 These open source tools should be further studied, modeled and explored in order to maintain open libraries of tools and documentation and establish connections with organizations who need help designing and deploying them (which could also serve as opportunities for service groups to develop revenue streams for further work and research).
 
 üéØ The Purpose of this Research Group:
 Our mission is to drive forward the research, development, education, and application of Bonding Curves in their various forms. This research group will provide chain agnostic research, development, education, and application of Bonding Curves in their various forms. This R&D will attract new talent and interest in the field of Token Engineering and to other blockchain ecosystems. Additionally, it will support building a common understanding and language around bonding curves and their applications to DAOs, businesses, finance, and economics. 
 
 This research offers improvements for understanding the design and ongoing operation of these new economic mechanisms, benefiting the field of Token Engineering directly through upgraded tools like open source libraries, models, simulations, and dashboards. The research and development also has huge impact through networking and deal flow for any blockchain ecosystem that would like to make use of these tool sets, open libraries, primitives, and research.
 
 Bonding curves are an emergent, Web3 native, economic primitive that redefine markets and liquidity. By determining price as proportional to supply, liquidity can be built into an economy, ending the era of market crunches, and enabling transparent and discoverable market prices for assets. The research, development and education in token economic primitives like bonding curves and cutting-edge research in the TE field has profound potential and implications for our economic systems.

By integrating decentralized finance (DeFi) functionalities with the robust attestation mechanisms of ZB, AttestDeFi bridges the gap between skill verification and tangible rewards in the Web3 ecosystem.
 
 Developed as a prototype during the **Superhack 2024** organized by ETH Global, AttestDeFi garnered significant recognition, securing the **Best Onchain Funding App 2nd place** award from **Celo**.
 
 **Key Features**
 
 - **On-Chain Attestation Integration**: Utilizes the **Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) SDK** to fetch attested addresses based on specific schemas, attestors, or event IDs from Zenbit Badges.
 - **Simplified Token Distribution**: Employs a **Disperse contract** to efficiently distribute tokens to multiple verified participants in a single transaction.
 - **User-Friendly DApp Interface**: Built on **Scaffold ETH**, providing an intuitive platform for event organizers to manage token distributions.
 - **Secure and Transparent**: Leverages ethereum technology to ensure all transactions are immutable and transparently recorded on-chain.
 
 **How It Works**
 
 1. **Attestation Retrieval**: AttestDeFi connects with the EAS to retrieve a list of addresses that have received attestations under a specific schema or from a particular attestor/event within Zenbit Badges.
 2. **Token Distribution Setup**: Event organizers specify the amount of tokens to distribute to the verified addresses.
 3. **Disperse Contract Execution**: The distribution is carried out through a **Disperse contract**, which allows for the simultaneous transfer of tokens to multiple addresses, reducing gas fees and transaction times.
 
 **Integration with Zenbit Badges**
 
 AttestDeFi enhances the Zenbit Badges ecosystem by providing a practical application of on-chain attestations:
 
 - **Incentivizing Participation**: By offering token rewards to participants who have earned Zenbit Badges, it encourages greater engagement in events and activities.
 - **Streamlining Processes**: Automates what would otherwise be a manual and time-consuming task of distributing tokens to numerous participants.
 - **Enhancing Trust**: Ensures that only verified participants receive tokens, maintaining the integrity of the distribution process.
 
 **Technical Stack**
 
 - **Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) SDK**: Core to fetching and verifying attested addresses.
 - **Disperse Contract**: Enables efficient batch token transfers in a single blockchain transaction.
 - **Scaffold ETH DApp**: Provides the foundational framework for the user interface and interaction with smart contracts.
 - **Blockchain Networks**: Compatible with Ethereum and potentially extendable to other EVM-compatible chains for broader accessibility.
 
 **Future Enhancements**
 
 - **Expanded Network Support**: Plans to integrate with multiple blockchain networks to offer flexibility and reduce transaction costs.
 - **Advanced Filtering Options**: Implementing more sophisticated criteria for selecting attested addresses, such as badge levels or specific achievements.
 - **User Experience Improvements**: Enhancing the DApp interface for even more intuitive use, including analytics and reporting features for organizers.
 - **Security Audits**: Conducting thorough audits of smart contracts to ensure the highest level of security and trustworthiness.
 
 AttestDeFi represents a significant step forward in leveraging on-chain attestations for practical applications within the Web3 ecosystem. By facilitating efficient and secure token distributions to verified participants, it not only adds value to the Zenbit Badges platform but also sets a precedent for future developments in decentralized funding mechanisms.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/611/11

 Re/Village works on commons space, shared ritual, and community infrastructure to support a Seven Generations Vision for the Green Valley bioregion of West Sonoma County, CA.
 
 **Introduction to Our Bioregion**
 
 Our bioregion is nestled in the beautiful and ecologically rich landscape of Graton, California, part of West Sonoma County's Green Valley. This area is defined by its rolling hills, vineyards, farmland, and forests. Economically, the region is sustained by agriculture, eco-tourism, and small businesses. Our community of approximately 1,800 residents embodies a diverse cultural mix, with a significant proportion of Latino agricultural workers. The area's culture is shaped by its agricultural roots, a long history of Bay Area progressivism in artists, spiritual and co-living communities and more recently tech, with a growing emphasis on regenerative agroecology and local business development.
 
 We‚Äôve mapped our bioregion based on both its ecological and social boundaries. The Green Valley watershed, which provides both natural resources and livelihood opportunities, connects the region. Key features such as the West County Regional Trail, the Green Valley Creek, and native habitats further define this area. This collaborative mapping process has emerged from community input, engaging local residents and historians, farmers, and environmental groups to co-create a vision that blends ecological integrity with sustainable economic activities.
 
 ### **Collective Challenges and Regeneration Opportunities**
 
 The primary challenges faced by our bioregion include **environmental** threats like wildfires and drought, which strain the local ecosystem and agricultural activities. **Socially**, there is a divide between the long-term residents and the primarily Latino day laborer community. **Culturally**, the town lacks an energetic heart‚Äîcentral, accessible spaces for residents of all backgrounds to gather, celebrate, and work together on local projects. The town is missing a vibrant hearth and the effects that a common shared space has on weaving people and place together.
 
 In response to these challenges, we see exciting opportunities for regeneration. The Graton Town Square project is a ""tipping point"" initiative designed to serve as a vibrant hub for ecological restoration, economic development, and cultural exchange. We are implementing principles of permaculture and regenerative design in the Town Square, which will feature rain gardens, native pollinator habitats, and spaces for local markets and events. These efforts not only aim to heal the land but also foster social cohesion and economic resilience through community participation.
 
 ### **The Bioregional Organizing Team**
 
 Re/Village Green Valley began in late summer of 2023 with a project to acquire a former gas-station site and rehabilitate the land into a vibrant town square/commons for our small town of Graton. Over this first year, our effort has engaged nearly a thousand community members through our Design Committee, Community Advisory Council, Volunteer Days, Town Hall Meetings, School Field Trips, and our recent ‚ÄúGraton Day: The Green Valley Festival‚Äù event.
 
 Our core organizing team consists of facilitators and creatives who are weaving together a network of both formal organizations, such as the Graton Community Services District (GCSD) and the Gold Ridge Resource Conservation District, alongside an informal network of local residents, business owners, and volunteers. As we continue to grow, we aim to expand our collaboration by involving local schools, Indigenous communities, and other regional organizations to foster a regenerative economy that benefits everyone.
 
 ### **Indigenous Engagement and Community Voices**
 
 Our initiative recognizes the need for deeper engagement with Indigenous Peoples and their wisdom in shaping our bioregion‚Äôs future. We are actively working to strengthen our relationships with the local indigenous community ‚Äì particularly the Federated Tribes of the Graton Rancheria and Heron‚Äôs Shadow Project in our watershed. We hold a deep conviction as a team that we are all ‚Äúindigenous to somewhere‚Äù and thus need to become ‚Äúmore indigenous to ourselves.‚Äù This conviction feeds a slowness and patience with building decolonial relationships in a good way, while at the same time holding a deep humbleness and reverence for the place-keepers of these lands where we are settlers.
 
 ### **Current Role and Future Vision**
 
 Building a town square is a **potent and symbolic starting point** for our bioregional organizing effort. Our organizing over the past year has created a foundational understanding of the relationships, allies, and ‚Äústory of place‚Äù that will seed further regenerative actions. We‚Äôve begun to meet many local leaders, with critical projects ranging from water, land and forest regeneration, to food, housing, and cultural development. **Many initiatives are small, under-resourced, or disconnected and will benefit immensely from the organization and (multiple forms of capital) mobilized by a BFF.** We are particularly excited to start publicly co-creating our Seven Generations Village Visions (starting with the town of Graton) and Green Valley **Bioregional Regeneration Strategy**.
 
 Our primary financial initiatives so far have been public funding (Sonoma Land Trust, Sonoma County Community Infrastructure Grants, Ag & Open Space Grant) and a community capital campaign. We are in the early stages of designing a number of regenerative finance instruments ‚Äì including a DAF investment vehicle, a social enterprise development company, and a stewardship trust to hold land, local businesses, and housing assets. The Bioregional Trust and Bioregional Venture Studio models both organically fit into the near-term evolution of the work that wants to happen here!
 
 ### **Funding Vision**
 
 Thus far, we have supported our work through a combination of public grants, local fundraising efforts, and volunteer contributions. However, we recognize that **more sustainable financial mechanisms are needed to support long-term regenerative initiatives**. Our current funding flows are relatively **fragmented**, and we see this **project as an opportunity to create a more transparent and synergistic financial ecosystem**. By utilizing grants like those from Gitcoin and other sources, we aim to **cohere diverse funding streams** and practice collective governance in resource allocation.
 
 Our vision includes d**eveloping bioregional financing mechanisms that can channel resources toward regenerative projects** in agriculture, education, and community development. We see potential in forming partnerships with regional land trusts, creating cooperative funding models, and exploring revenue-generating activities such as community events and eco-tourism.****
 
 With Gitcoin funding, we will continue to lean into our **catalytic community events, storytelling initiatives, and development of basic financial infrastructure**. We are grateful for your support in all the ways, and to be part of this larger movement for bioregional resilience.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/18/11

 However, starting and managing them remains challenging. We believe we can contribute a piece of the puzzle here üß© to make it easier to start or join them.
 
 Open Collective‚Äôs mission has always been about providing a new form of organization for the Internet Generation.
 
 In 2015, we launched Open Collective by creating a new abstraction layer on top of existing non-profits.

 This enabled more than 3500 collectives to exist. Together, they raised more than $100M (https://discover.opencollective.com). This includes a couple of web3 projects and communities that needed to raise good old fiat money for some of their activities ([ReFI Lisboa](https://opencollective.com/refi-lisboa), [Circles UBI](https://opencollective.com/circles), [She256](https://opencollective.com/she256_), [Breadchain](https://opencollective.com/breadchain-cooperative), [Peercoin](https://opencollective.com/peercoin), [Dandelion](https://opencollective.com/dandelion-events), [even metamask gave it a try in their early days](https://opencollective.com/metamask)).
 
 Kevin told me, ‚ÄúOpen Collective was one of my inspirations to start Gitcoin‚Äù (‚ÄúOpen Collective was the OG Open Source Software crowdfunding platform‚Äù - [Kevin Owocki](https://x.com/owocki/status/1131566719099473920)).
 
 We actually have quite a story together already. In March 2021, Open Collective and Gitcoin worked together to [bring quadratic funding to web2 open source projects](https://opencollective.com/fundoss) ([see also the wrap party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5z10Bpgw6dk)).
 
 And in December 2021, with our fiscal host dedicated to climate projects ([allforclimate.earth](https://allforclimate.earth)), we worked together to create the [first Gitcoin Climate Round](https://x.com/gitcoin/status/1466504363635929092) üåç ([see finale event](https://www.youtube.com/live/W-doVjkkZbg?si=NLGOz-0rV_Petq7N&t=1640)).
 
 However, Open Collective has been stuck in the world of fiat. Earlier this month, we decided to ‚Äúexit to community‚Äù the current business, so that we can make space for starting a new web3 branch.
 
 üìñ Read: [The Open Collective Platform is Moving to a Community Governed Non-profit](https://blog.opencollective.com/the-open-collective-platform-is-moving-to-a-community-governed-non-profit/)
 
 **What if we would fund this new web3 branch as a community?**
 
 Here is our commitment: 
 - Everything we do will be open source (always has been)
 - We will do as much on-chain as possible to ensure great compatibility with any other dapp.
 - We will eventually exit the company to the community (like we did with the current branch) through a DAO (with progressive decentralization)
 
 ## What would Open Collective v3 offer?
 
 A simple platform to manage common resources as a community (aka commons):
 
 Concretely:
 - A way for your project to provide much more visibility on how you are spending the funds you raised (with gitcoin, crypto, fiat)
 - A user friendly interface that normies can use to take part in your DAO

 # **Practical Use Cases**
 
 **1. Retroactive funding:** Pairwise, combined with categories, is what we are having more fun with to potentiate RetroPGF. Categories help make Pairwise voting easier and faster. By grouping similar projects, voters get to compare apples to apples and can get accurate rankings with fewer clicks. This approach also enables three benefits that would otherwise not be possible.
 
 * Enabling Expertise to Shine: Our approach allows voters to focus on their areas of expertise and interest. With this categorization, voters will rank projects in the domains where their expertise and interests lie, ensuring that the ranking of projects is informed by knowledgeable insights, without imposing on voters the need to review all the projects to participate. This approach allows us to maximize the value derived from voters' time and contributions, and for a more effective ranking of projects, as each voter brings their specialized knowledge to the table, aiding in Project Discovery to Build Ecosystem Network Effects.
 
 * Making DAOing Fun: Voting in a DAO shouldn‚Äôt have to feel like work. It should be fun and rewarding! DAOs to get excited about every round of Retro round!. It will feel like a tournament-esque competition where participants discover their own preferences and a lot of cool projects. Voters will talk about their opinions on Twitter and in real life (IRL) while anticipating the voting results. The voting process is simple and fun; it can be done in one solid hack session or, since your voting progress will be saved, it can be done in many parts during boring calls and while you have free moments throughout the week. The voting experience will feel less like voting and more like scrolling on social media or swiping on a dating app. Let‚Äôs be real, it won‚Äôt be that amazing, but still much better than the normal voting process ;-)
 
 **2. Decentralized Curation and Ranking:** Pairwise can be used to compare, rank and curate projects, content, products, or services, and can serve as a ‚Äúdecentralized suggestion algorithm‚Äù. One use case being explored is with Giveth, where users can vote on projects that they are passionate about, which would then feed into the website ranking. This not only allows the community to vote on what projects are important for them, but it also opens the door for new projects to surface that otherwise would have not received the same exposure.
 
 **3. User research:** A fun use case is user research, where the community can be polled on what their subjective preferences are. For example, this can be used within any DAO to decide on features as kind of a ‚Äúhot or not‚Äù game, where users can vote on specific designs or traits, to determine which ones are most valued by the community.
 
 # **Newest Features**
 
 * Mobile & Desktop experience: We actually have two different versions‚Äîone that works on both mobile and desktop, and another that works only on desktop. The latter is the one that currently has the star rating feature.
 
 * Star rating: Users can give different star ratings to projects, which will significantly reduce the number of comparisons a user has to make. Projects will be compared with others that have the same star rating.
 
 * Pseudonymous Voting: True anonymity was not possible while maintaining on-chain voting, so we made it pseudonymous instead.
 
 Here is how we did it:
 
 1. Voters log in with traditional web2 login methods to create an AA wallet (via Thirdweb)
 
 2. The voters then can connect this new AA wallet to their existing OP mainnet address which holds their Superchain reputation using a zk proof (via Semaphore group managed by Bandada).
 
 3. The OP mainnet address is never used again and the voter uses their AA wallet to create votes as attestations (via EAS), and to maintain anonymity, we sponsor the transactions.
 
 The zk tech, to be specific, ‚Äúthe semaphore group‚Äù of users‚Äô anonymous identities is what makes the Pairwise experience anonymous and the AA wallet experience is what makes the voting experience so magical.
 
 * Tinder Filtering: One of the feedback points we received during the Optimism RetroPGF round was that many projects a badgeholder didn't want to support kept reappearing. And we developed this flow, and people love it. In the future, we will also include direct feedback for projects so that we can collectively shape any ecosystem!

 # GG21 History 
 Noah Chon Lee made this post proposing how fiat donation could work 
 https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/10-000-donated-to-gitcoin-zuzalu-round-with-credit-card-pilot-project-proposal/18827 
 
 The viaPrize team successfully built this for the Open Civics and Collab Tech rounds for GG21. https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/we-donated-to-gitcoin-projects-with-credit-card-review-of-paypal-fiat-payments-in-gg21/19287 
 
 Most of the other round leads during GG21 heard of this and asked if we could do the same thing for them. Unfortunately, we didn't have the resources to meet this community demand. 
 
 The GG21 rounds we did have the funds to support worked successfully. 
 OpenCivics fiat stats: 
 Average PayPal donation size - $62.30 (crypto avg was $11.21) 
 PayPal donation volume - 7.21% 
 See their review here: https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg21-retrospective-opencivics-collaborative-research-round/19313 
 
 # How this works 
 From the user's perspective, they just check out using fiat like they would in any normal web2 online store. From the smart contract's perspective, it just receives funds from a wallet like in any web3 platform. 
 Steps: 
 -User sends $10 with PayPal (for example) 
 -Our team sends 10 USDC from our own wallet 
 -10 USDC lands in a custodial wallet associated with that user's PayPal account (1 wallet per PayPal account) 
 -The 10 USDC continues on to the Gitcoin smart contract 
 
 The donation shows up on-chain within a few seconds of the user sending a fiat payment. 
 
 This means we need a ready supply of stablecoins in our own wallet that we replenish over time. 
 
 Sybil resistance consists of whether it is a ""verified PayPal account."" After the round, we whitelist the wallets associated with the verified accounts to receive matching.
 
 # Potential Integration in Grants Stack 
 We believe the fiat donation volume would be much higher (perhaps 10-30%) if we had this feature built directly into Grants Stack instead of on a separate website. 
 This is also preferred so our team isn't stretched thin maintaining an entire Gitcoin copy instead of building in this particular feature. 
 
 With a single change that we already have ready, we believe we could increase Allo GMV by 10-30% today. 
 
 Long-term, this could result in multiple times more Allo GMV as Gitcoin transitions from purely a crypto platform to a blockchain-based platform that anyone can use. This accessibility may open partnerships with major institutions. 
 
 We have this proposal written here for our team to be funded to build this into grants stack and we were encouraged by Sov, Meg, Kat, and Ed to put it to a DAO vote. Currently we are reviewing the legal side to make sure everything is considered before a vote. https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gcp-017-updated-proposal-for-fiat-donations-in-grants-stack/19446 
 
 If this goes well, we think we would transition viaPrize into a nonprofit and build up a for profit company normie.tech helping more web3 platforms be accessible to non-crypto users. 
 
 This could mean a future where people can send fiat directly to a smart contract. Users wouldn't need an onramp (which fail 78% of the time) or a steep learning curve to participate in web3. 
 Web3 would be accessible to 100x as many people.

 A central goal of Regenerate Cascadia is to grow capacity cohesively across the scales of landscapes, ecoregions, and bioregions‚Äîsomething that currently does not exist locally or globally‚Äîas part of a multi-generational strategy for the long-term health of the Cascadia bioregion.
 
 ![Cascadia BioFi Facility](https://regeneratecascadia.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-22-130136.png)
 
 **Regenerate Cascadia is developing a critical path toward accelerated landscape-level regeneration across Cascadia that invites people to self-organize into bioregional teams and hubs in order to visualize, connect, and support work in their watersheds. Particularly through participatory activities and capacity-building. We invite these groups to consider:**
 >*What does a regenerative future for our bioregion look like? If people were resourced to make this happen, how can this have the most impact and connect regenerators on the ground with funders and the technology we need, as best determined by the people doing the work? How do we build the buy-in and consent of our communities? And lastly, how do we use this ‚Äúmoment‚Äù to lead to a regenerative future rather than see it fizzle away?*
 
 The mission of Regenerate Cascadia is to regenerate the Cascadia bioregion and create the conditions for a regenerative culture to thrive. As part of this, we educate about bioregionalism, grow the shared context of our place, and give direct funding for the core capacity of teams and projects. We provide much-needed administrative scaffolding as groups are beginning so they can receive and leverage decentralized flow funding and spin out new bioregional initiatives as part of a shared, coherent, multi-generational regeneration strategy.
 
 This first funding round will assist our watershed working groups in locations throughout Cascadia and help us experiment with new forms of shared governance and participatory budgeting processes at the landscape level.
 
 # Now, we need your help to connect on-the-ground regenerative organizers, projects, and communities with the power and tools of Web3. 
 
 ![Cascadia BioFi Facility](https://regeneratecascadia.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2024/10/667c5f66bb46f07b901872e9_what-is-bff-3-layer-image-2-1024x775.png)
 *Figure 2: What is a BFF from the BioFi website - https://biofi.earth*
 
 Web3 can help break down and move past arbitrary boundaries, map what is important to our communities, identify what needs to be protected, and connect portfolios of projects in the context of an entire landscape in ways we can directly fund and de-risk. We need to create tools for measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) built through community consent and data sovereignty that help tell the stories of stewardship in ways that catalyze financial flows. 
 
 **We deeply believe in the founding beliefs of these tools, as outlined by Celo:** 
 >Web3 represents an internet where users have more control over their data, identity, and digital assets. This means no central authority controls the network, allowing for more transparency, security, and ownership. Web3 empowers individuals by giving them full control over their digital assets (like cryptocurrencies and NFTs) and how they interact with online services, making it a key shift towards a more open, user-owned internet. In short, Web3 is about returning power to the users‚Äîcreating a more equitable digital world where your data and assets are yours to manage and control. 
 
 Together, we can learn to move money into communities at the scale of a watershed and across nation-state borders‚Äìreimagining finance flows so they no longer divide ecosystems and reinforce systematic inequality and racism‚Äìbut instead create new stories of shared stewardship that truly represent the full spectrum of life present in place.

 # Where does this idea come from?
 ![Regenerate Cascadia Activation Tour](https://regeneratecascadia.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-22-110114.png)
 *Figure 3: Our Regenerate Cascadia activation tour. 14 communities in 30 days.*
 
 Regenerate Cascadia grew from the 2022 global Regenerative Communities Network summit and was officially formed by Brandon Letsinger and Clare Attwell in April 2023 during the first-ever Salmon Nation Edge Prize, where their vision to activate a bioregional movement in Cascadia won the Edge Prize for Innovation in Systems and Governance. 
 
 After months of planning with 100+ local community organizers on both sides of the Canada-US border, they partnered with the Design School for Regenerating Earth to co-facilitate a month-long Bioregional Activation Tour. We traveled to 14 communities around Cascadia during October 2023, hosting presentations that asked, ‚ÄúHow do we regenerate the Cascadia bioregion?‚Äù. They met with more than 1000 individuals, including Indigenous knowledge keepers, regenerative leaders, groups, community artists, and elders across Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, through presentations, workshops, site visits, and strategy sessions. 
 
 ![Regenerate Cascadia Activation Tour](https://regeneratecascadia.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2023/08/1_eqaYNw0RA-hHEKcuqC4phA.jpg)
 *Figure 4: Regenerate Cascadia was joined by Joe Brewer, Penny Heiple and Steven Morris from the Design School from Regenerating Earth. Every stop featured presentations, strategy sessions, field trips, and a showcase of regenerative work.*
 
 This was followed by an online summit that brought together 50+ presentations in a ‚ÄòFestival of What Works‚Äô and concluded with an Open Space Unconference from November 3-12, 2023, where participants created working groups for Regenerate Cascadia. The vision resonated strongly with many communities across the bioregion, and since then have been working with an organizing team of more than 140 people through Telegram, exploring place-based ""hubs,"" issue-specific ""guilds,"" and supporting a range of amazing and emerging projects, made up of people on-the-ground doing regenerative work in-place.

 Nature acts bioregionally. Be it wildfire, drought, flood, energy, food sovereignty, or social and political polarization, to develop adaptive resilience, every community impacted must have substantial influence on decision-making processes, and every community along a watershed must be included. It is the people living here, rather than in power centers thousands of miles away, who are best able to determine the most resilient pathways and actions for themselves and their communities.

 ### *If you're unfamiliar with the idea of Cascadia or the Cascadia movement.... below is a bit of context about the bioregion and movement.*
 
 -------------------------------------------------------
 
 # What is Cascadia?
 Stretching for more than 2500 along the Pacific Rim, the Cascadia bioregion includes British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and parts of Southeast Alaska and Northern California. It is defined through the geology and watersheds of the Fraser, Snake, and Columbia Rivers.
 
 ![Cascadia Bioregion Map](https://regeneratecascadia.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2024/10/McCloskeyCascadiaGiantMapESRIUC.jpg)
 *Figure 7: The Cascadia bioregion map by David McCloskey graced the cover of ESRI in 2014 and was featured on the cover of it's annual book. Featuring more than 70 GIS layers, McCloskey published some of the first maps in the 1980's, and coined the term ""Cascadia bioregion"" as a Seattle University professor in 1981.*
 
 We have tremendous opportunities for systemic and strategic impact here and are often considered a ""thin green line"" between resource extraction to the east and developing markets in Asia. 
  
 >The Cascadia bioregion is home to more than 16 million people (16,029,520). It has an economy generating more than 1.613147 trillion worth of goods and services annually, making it the world's ninth-largest economy and roughly equivalent to that of Canada or Italy. Its population would be similar in size to Ecuador, Zambia, Cambodia, or the Netherlands. Cascadia contains the largest tracts of untouched old-growth temperate rainforests in the world, including 7 of the top 10 world carbon-absorbing forests, the world's tallest trees, thousands of volcanoes, hot springs, rivers, lakes, inlets, islands, and ocean, and some of the last diminishing, though still impressive wild habitats of salmon, wolves, bear, whale, orca. More than 350 bird and mammal species, 48 reptiles, hundreds of fungi, lichen, and thousands of invertebrates and soil organisms call Cascadia home.
 
 The Cascadia bioregion also transcends the arbitrary border between the United States and Canada, **and so must our planning**. This is true when looking at the Salish Sea (a shared ecosystem between Seattle and Vancouver, BC, in which eight million people live), the Cascadia subduction zone, which runs the entire length of Cascadia and is where our next megaquake will come from, or the Cascadia megaregion, an urban core between Vancouver, BC and Eugene, OR where 80% of the population live on 17% of the landmass. 
 
 The Columbia River watershed alone, the largest in Cascadia, includes parts of six US states and one Canadian province. Its border is traced ‚Äúnot by governments or treaties, but by every drop of liquid that finds a common path to the ocean.‚Äù
 
 # What is the Cascadia Movement?
 Cascadians are brought together by their love of place and desire to protect the things we find special while improving the well-being of everyone and everything living here.
 
 ![First Cascadia Bioregional congress](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/521b7c54e4b0e63c9a89da62/1444322621990-ZGM7W2JO6FJKW9RZWWZ9/image-asset.jpeg)
 *Figure 8: Cascadian bioregional congresses took place every other year from 1986, timed to coincide with the North American bioregional congress, as well as smaller local regional ""Ish River"" gatherings.*
 
 Cascadia was first used as a geologic description in 1981 by Seattle University professor David McCloskey to better describe our growing regional identity. McCloskey describes Cascadia as ‚Äúa land of falling waters.‚Äù He notes the blending of the natural integrity and the sociocultural unity that gives Cascadia its character. It was officially incorporated by policy planners, First Nations, and community organizers at the first Cascadia Bioregional Congress in 1986.
 
 Today, the Cascadia movement includes tens of thousands of individuals, businesses, and community groups throughout the Cascadia bioregion. Cascadia has been featured in many publications, such as Vice Magazine, USA Today, NPR, the CBC, NY Times, CNN, Forbes, Portland Monthly, the Seattle Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Oregonian, and many others.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/18/12

 ![Results](https://i.postimg.cc/wMRQs0bw/Treegens-Banner-01.png)
 
 # üå≥ THE CHALLENGE üå≥
 
 **Misaligned Incentives**
 
 Today our economy values the degeneration of nature more than it values the regeneration of nature. According to the UNEP, approximately 1.9 billion trees are planted yearly, yet approx. 15 billion are cut down each year. We Are losing forests at a rate equivalent to 27 soccer fields per minute! 
 
 **Impact Transparency**
 
 The impact sector faces criticism for not providing enough transparency. Peer reviewed studies have shown that donations increase by 52% within 1 year when nonprofits earn a seal of transparency. The amount of funds on the sidelines, not funding what matters could make all the difference for the climate crisis. 
 
 # üå≥ HOW WE'RE SOLVING IT üå≥
 
 ### Proof of Plant
 
 ![Results](https://i.postimg.cc/J43g2Z1p/Proof-of-Plant.png)
 
 The only way to create the $MGRO token is through Proof of Plant. Tree planters onboard through account abstraction / social logins, learn how to plant & film the mangrove trees, film the land before & after planting within our DApp with GPS automatically captured, then submit the data for DAO verification. 
 
 ![Results](https://i.postimg.cc/4NypnJSB/Mockups-1-3.png)
 
 Treegen DAO members verify that the methodology of our 6 mangrove experts was followed in order to issue $MGRO. They also confirm that the trees were filmed correctly for our tree counting AI (one continual direction). 
 
 # üå≥ MANGROVE ADVISORS üå≥
 ![Results](https://i.postimg.cc/JncNV7zm/9.png)
 
 Treegen planters are also incentivised to do health checks. 1/6th of an $MGRO token is minted per tree for the initial plant, another 1/6th after the health check after 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 & 36 months. Any non surviving trees are reflected in the subsequential issuance such that 1 $MGRO token represents 1 mangrove tree that has grown to the point of 3 years.
 
 ![Results](https://i.postimg.cc/QxRztRCK/download-4.gif)
 
 Similar to Proof of Stake, $TGN token holders stake their governance token to verify the videos, assisted by AI tree counting. There are always multiple verifiers. If maliciously or carelessly approved or rejected, the DAO member will have a portion of their TGN slashed for accountability. 
 
 # üå≥ FINANCIAL MODEL üå≥
 Our tokenomics is designed such that 95% of $MGRO tokens goes to the tree planters on the ground & 5% goes to the DAO verifiers as rewards. We additionally aim to stream retro rewards to the $MGRO holders from our centralised carbon projects, EBF Forwards & grant funds. 
 
 ![download](https://i.postimg.cc/gJmr3zcw/Untitled-design-8.gif)
 
 ### Non-Fungible Updates (NFU)
 ![Results](https://i.postimg.cc/W3xQzSsn/download-14.gif)
 
 Every verified video becomes viewable on the Treegens DAO map as a Non-Fungible Update video. In order for companies or individuals to make an ecological claim that they funded trees, they buy these NFT videos with $MGRO tokens, which burns / retires $MGRO.
 
 # üå≥ EXPONENTIAL REGENERATION üå≥
 
 Treegens DAO was designed to **scale** tree planting around the world. We will achieve exponential regeneration through carbon forwards. As an organisation we will be planting mangroves and sell the future value of the carbon credits as forwards. These forward funds are at a discounted rate yet still an order of magnitude more than what it costs to plant. By reinvesying these funds back into more mangroves & repeating this process, we will multiply our mangroves by approximately 9X. We will also stream a portion of these revenues towards retroacively rewarding $MGRO holders & stakers, making people bullish on tree planting!
 
 ![Results](https://i.postimg.cc/wxZKgsw5/download-16.gif)
 
 # üå≥INNOVATIVE GAMIFICATIONüå≥
 
 We‚Äôre making regeneration both financially and emotionally rewarding through gamification. Trees funded and planted are showcased on a leaderboard.
 
 We're also introducing the world‚Äôs first Dynamic Semi-Soulbound Token (DSST) to gamify tree planting and funding. The mind orb brightens as you fund trees (retiring $MGRO for non-fungible updates), and the heart orb brightens as you plant trees ( $MGRO is minted into your wallet). While the artwork is transferable, the orbs displaying impact metrics are not, appearing on whichever Treegen NFT you connect to our DApp. This innovation allows you to earn, not just buy, a visual Regen score, while still enabling customization and trading.

 # üå≥ USER-CENTRIC DESIGN üå≥
 
 Treegens DAO has partnered with the legends at General Magic for our frontend development & UI/UX design. GM has helped us leverage email or Google Login / Wallet Creation to easily onboard tree planters in developing countries around the world. GM has supported Giveth, clr.fund, TEC, ENS, The Commons Stack & many more impactful DAOs to create smooth user experiences & develop their front end.

 Through account abstration & world class UI/UX, we're able to onboard users who have never head of web3. Treegens is growing a movement of tree planters through the 1B tree campaign & by doing so, we will be driving large numebers of users towards Celo, which will be apart of the Optimism Superchain soon. 
 
 
 # üå≥STREAMED RETRO REGEN REWARDSüå≥
 To GROW the movement & make everyone bullish on Regeneration, we plan to retroactively reward MGRO holders by streaming rewards to them via. SuperFluid. From Grant funds, Optimism RetroPGF, Optimism's Growth Experiment Grants, EBF Forwards & yield from $Earth in our treasury will all flow towards $MGRO holders. 
 
 # üå≥ USE OF FUNDS üå≥
 
 Additional funding will enable us to develop the MGRO's buyers journey & integrate chain abstraction through Aracana Network. This will be a gamechanger because customers will be able to use most ETH L2 tokens to mint MGRO & TGN without needing to bridge! 
 
 # üå≥ UPDATED ROUGH TIMELINE üå≥

 ---
 Vocdoni's vision [1] is to improve democratic health and promote participatory governance using decentralized and open-source technology. To achieve that, we are building the Vocdoni Protocol, a censorship-resistant, secure, anonymous (using zkSNARKs) and transparent voting protocol to facilitate decision-making for communities and organizations regardless of whether they are digital natives or traditional organizations.
 
 For implementing the voting protocol, Vocdoni developed the Vochain [2], a public voting blockchain, as well as a set of tools that facilitate its usage such as an API [3], an SDK [4] and dApps. Today, this technology serves numerous organizations around the world by providing them with a secure, transparent, easy-to-use and low-cost voting system.
 
 
 Along with the Vocdoni Protocol we have 4 sub-products:
 
 - Vocdoni APP: A digital voting platform for traditional organizations that allows for many types of voting methods and censuses, is agnostic to authentication methods and allows for anonymous voting using zkSNARKs.
 - Onvote APP: A digital voting platform for DAOs and Web3 communities that allows for many type of web3 census including Gitcoin Passport, NFT-based, ERC20-based or whitelisted. It also allows anonymous votes using zkSNARKs
 - Farcaster.vote: A digital voting platform that allows users to create polls that can be voted on directly in Farcaster's social feed.
 - Vocdoni API: Integrate Vocdoni protocol into any platform and service with an easy-to-use SDK.
 
 All our code is published as open-source code under the AGPL-3.0 license. Also, our Blockchain acts as a public-good voting protocol.

 Circuitscan is a circuit verifier explorer. Like verified contracts, a verified circuit verifier allows users to interact with applications directly if the frontend becomes unusable as well as ensures that the deployed source code matches the expected source code. Developers use a CLI to submit their circom sources to the verification server just like how Hardhat and Foundry submit deployed contracts to Etherscan. The frontend catalogs all verified submissions with source code and proving keys available for usage.
 
 Circuit verifier Solidity contracts verified on Etherscan are opaque to the viewer. There's no way to quickly check that they match the source code on Github. When users can see this match, they can be sure that there's no backdoors inserted clandestinely.
 
 Verified contracts on etherscan also come into play when a dapp's frontend becomes unusable. For a zk app with a missing frontend, Circuitscan provides a tool for generating proofs so that users never have to worry about being locked out.

 Dappnode is a decentralized infrastructure platform that allows users to easily host their own decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain nodes. Dappnode makes it easy to host and run various types of blockchain software, such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, IPFS, and others. The platform also provides users with a user-friendly interface to manage and monitor their nodes.
 
 ![dappnode-dashboard](https://bafybeidnqnfyvbsyd3pxhpxxdhharclupqmkrdphyzvgc4mpqnhq2lvx5i.ipfs.w3s.link/dappnode-dashboard-gg.png)
 
 One of the key benefits of using Dappnode is that it enables users to participate in decentralized networks without needing to rely on centralized infrastructure, such as cloud hosting providers. Users also don't require to have a high technical skillset, since the Dappnode UI makes it easy for users at all levels of technical experience to run their own nodes.
 Solo staking in Dappnode is made simple thanks to the Stakers Menu, which allows you to set up an Ethereum node ready to validate in a few clicks:
 
 ![stakersmenu.png](https://bafybeibus3tmm7dtxrbtoo6m7knxrwrmkatiublxpcjxz2cbod4mnrxdiy.ipfs.w3s.link/ethereum-staking-screenshot-d41fdd2a5a44f0e9e7f4094c41ea9e2d.png)
 
 Dappnode is an open-source project, which means that anyone can contribute to its development and improvement. The platform is also community-driven, with users collaborating to create and share tools and resources to enhance its functionality.
 
 One of Dappnode's features launched in the last year is its Rollups menu, catching up with the needs of its users for privacy as they adapt to scaling solutions in the Ethereum ecosystem. The first implementation was with Optimism, but we'll be expanding to other L2s in the following months. We specially look forward to adapting these new features to ways in which rollup sequencers can decentralize and offer incentives to participants. The Rollups Menu works just like the Stakers Menu:

 During 2024 we've also catched up with Distributed Validator Technology (DVT), enabling leading projects like Obol and SSV to integrate with current node operators using their own Dappnode packages. Setting up a distibuted validator cluster on Ethereum is a new feature that's now available to Dappnode users in just a few clicks.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/610/13

 Built on Tally‚Äôs [gov_deployer](https://github.com/withtally/gov_deployer), which leverages OpenZeppelin contracts, GovernorHaus serves as a DAO factory that streamlines the creation and governance process. Unlike Tally‚Äôs CLI utility, which requires a technical setup for deployment, GovernorHaus allows users to visit the website, connect their wallet, fill out a simple form, and confirm the transaction directly in their wallet‚Äîno complex configurations or command-line usage needed.
 
 Originally built during [ETHGlobal‚Äôs Superhack2024](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/governor-haus-anayc), we have since enhanced GovernorHaus with the following features:
 
 - **Integration with Tally's frontend:** DAOs are automatically created and visible within Tally upon deployment.
 - **Bulk import functionality:** Users can easily paste a list of addresses or ENS names with token allocations from a CSV, Excel, or Google Sheets document directly into the form, with fields being populated automatically.
 - **Enhanced user interface:** We've improved the overall design and styling for a more polished experience.

 # Motivation
 
 As the Web3 space has grown in recent years, grant programs run by protocols and projects have themselves exploded in size and popularity. Over a billion dollars in capital have been deployed or committed, grant programs have come and gone, and many organizations are now assessing the progress and impact of their issued funding.
 
 There have been¬†a wide range of approaches, from transparent (e.g. Aave) or closed (e.g. Ethereum Foundation and Solana Foundation) to communally architected (e.g. Stacks Foundation) to being launched by a compensated team (e.g. Mantle), from prospective (e.g. Uniswap Foundation) to retroactive (e.g. Optimism) to research-focused (e.g. Protocol Labs Research Grants) to quadratically funded (e.g. Gitcoin), to RFP-based (i.e. Protocol Labs, Uniswap Foundation, Solana Foundation, etc.). The diversity of thought on how to best run such programs has led to innovative approaches for grants management but has also fragmented capital and reduced transparency.
 
 This specification lays out a set of off-chain data schemas for grant programs looking to deploy funding and for projects looking to receive funding, as well as a simple attestations architecture. It is intended to increase interoperability between grants tooling, improve the transparency of grant programs, and ultimately make grant programs more efficient for funders, administrators, and grantees. In particular, this specification lays the groundwork for a ‚Äúcommon application‚Äù for grants as well as easier coordination between grants programs.

 **Our Bioregion, challenges, and opportunities**
 
 Our bioregion is characterized by diverse yet related Native peoples that have been unified through their relationships with their ancestral waterways, both riverine and maritime, evidenced by related Algonquin dialects being predominant throughout the region. These relationships have been purposefully fractured by colonization, which has an enduring impact through multiple layers of imposed bureaucracy, siloing of knowledge, and the proliferation of administrative mechanisms preventing the development of holistic regeneration strategies and Tribal self determination. The region has also been a major cradle of industrialization, and continues to have a strong manufacturing base despite an ongoing legacy of industrial decline. While we are possessed of immense financial and intellectual resources, we are also characterized by tremendous inequality in access to decision making spaces and wealth building opportunities. Taken together, these dynamics have resulted in interdependent challenges of ecosystem degradation, rapidly rising costs of often poor quality housing, a lack of self sufficiency in food production, regenerated but fragmented and ailing forests, depleted migratory, freshwater, and marine fisheries, an incomplete clean energy transition, strong car dependence, and extensive brownfields and ongoing industrial pollution. These challenges embody a fragmented dominant paradigm and culture.
 
 These profound challenges are being faced by a multitude of regenerative actors and organizations, presenting as seeds and rooted place based initiatives. These include resurgent Tribal governance and knowledge initiatives, a regional organic food movement and cooperative culture, agroforestry and forestry initiatives, regional and local conservation initiatives, community Justice organizations, a coalescence of bio-based material organizations, and many others.

 *Source: One Earth*
 
 **Our Origins and Direction**
 Our team was born from the impetus to create coherence in the bioregional space of the northeast - weaving together existing bioregional and regenerative organizations in a new formation. Together, we have identified a foundational need to strengthen resurgent Indigenous governance to guide the development of a bioregional regeneration strategy and financing facility.
 
 Our current core organizing team includes representatives from the Mashantucket Pequot and Eastern Pequot Tribal Nations, the Alliance for the Mystic River Watershed, Bio-Based Materials Collective (BBMC), Center for an Ecology-Based Economy (CEBE), Connecticut River Valley Bioregioning Collaborative, Design School for Regenerating Earth, Northeast Healthy Soils Network (NEHSN), Sirius Ecovillage, and Wellspring Commons. We are also actively communicating with and recruiting other key bioregional actors, including through Roberta Hill‚Äôs (of CEBE) participation in the Wabanaki Alliance Tribal Coalition. This constellation has significant and deep expertise in social and ecological systems transformation.
 
 This team is supported by network and blockchain finance experts from Bloom Network, Capital Institute, Co-creating Funding Ecosystems for Regeneration (CoFundEco), r3.0, Regen Network. Our members have conventional finance and investment banking experience, including managing DAFs, investment funds, and private placements; finance innovation experience, including DAO governance, community lending pools, federated cooperatives, retroactive public goods funding; and government grants.
 To further expand our diverse networks, we are working diligently to expand leadership and peer organizing to fully include the movements we aim to support.
 
 Co-led by intertribal groups, we are bringing together diverse stakeholders to strengthen relationships and create regenerative pathways for people and the planet. Our core goal is to increase coherence among regional actors currently working in largely siloed ways to address the interdependence of our regional challenges through systemic interventions.
 
 **Our Guiding Principles:**
 1. Restore Right Earth Relations: Strengthening right relationships between communities, land, water, and our built environment.
 2. Earth Regeneration: Implementing regenerative practices to heal and sustain ecosystems and the communities stewarding them.
 3. Allyship (Relationality): Building respectful, reciprocal relationships with Tribal and regional communities across the bioregion and between bioregions.
 4. Aligning Resources around Aliveness: Aligning resources to invigorate communities and the natural world.
  
 **Our Work To Date and at Present:**
 Over the last several months we have established relationships of trust across diverse existing networks, secured $25,000 in initial funding, and have agreed upon principles to guide our work and collaboration. We are working on developing a strategic vision including priority directions, alignment between our members, and securing commitments of time and resources to develop and implement our bioregional regeneration strategy. We share an intention for systemic transformation of capitalism, and feel our bioregion is truly ready to catalyze this, with the assistance of members in this organizing team who have decades of experience managing network finance across a wide array of traditional and innovative mechanisms, alongside deep facilitator and convener skill sets.

 *Funding Governance (r3.0) and CoFundEco*
 
 **Our Identified Needs for Holistic Bioregioning**
 We are working toward a comprehensive strategy to regenerate our bioregion. In support of translating our work from our principles to actionable interventions, we have identified overarching needs in the following sectors. These take as a common root the need to protect and regenerate our ecological lifelines and respect the agency of Earth and more than human life for its own sake.
 
 * Ecosystem Health: Mapping and understanding our ecological lifelines in order to protect and regenerate our ecosystems and biodiversity for their own health and wellbeing; respecting the agency of Earth and more than human life for its own sake.
 * Water: Source water protection, accelerating dam and barrier removal, restoring floodplains and wetland complexes, scaling regenerative wastewater and stormwater systems, addressing watershed scale water quantity/flood management and quality improvements through decentralized and integrated approaches by working across other sectors below along with exploring sustainable monetization strategies for coastal and inland ecosystems.
 * Energy: Implementing genuinely regenerative energy solutions, focusing on demand reduction/elimination, community-owned renewables, and innovative applications like solar concentration, and integrated parking lot, building, and roadway systems. Supporting novel energy storage systems.
 * Manufacturing: Promoting bio-based and regenerative manufacturing platforms, developing the missing middle of value added food and biomaterial processing, building regional and local supply chains, and cooperative business models, and facilitating urban regeneration.
 * Food and Agriculture: Scaling organic and regenerative production, expanding agroforestry systems, reviving Indigenous agro-ecologies, and enhancing regional food production including regeneration of inland and marine fisheries. Foodways is also where financing a bioregion comes into direct contact with the ground, and facilitates building relationships and shared experiences.
 * Housing: Developing affordable, non-toxic bio-based housing and building technologies in support of rural and urban regeneration through education, policy work, workforce development, processing capacity and infrastructure, and building sustainable supply chains.
 * Transportation: Expanding active and public transit integrated with green infrastructure, scaling electric aviation and light rail, eliminating car dependency.
 * Health: Aligning environmental restoration with improved healthcare outcomes to reduce lifetime costs and foster well-being, expand self care and mindfulness practices at the individual, community, and enterprise level, explore a regenerative health insurance model coupled with quality of life bonds for states and municipalities.
 * Finance: Stewarding a phase shift in our ability to gather, store, and allocate financial capital in service to the regeneration of our bioregion, based on the idea that regenerative outcomes require a regenerative approach to funding governance. Creating fractal self determined and self sustaining financial mechanisms.
 
 **What's Next and What Must Be Overcome:**
 Our coherence and movement building must address that challenge that we are modeling a more collaborative and decentralized approach to bioregional finance, against a backdrop of pre-existing regional networks in the Northeast. This takes more time and is more complicated, though it offers tremendous value to the bioregional networks movement as we become able to share examples. Acknowledgment of this fact by the bioregional funding networks in terms of time pressure and support for the additional layer of coordination overhead, will ensure our success in what we have to share, and help us build regenerative experiences together as we do this path-forging work.
 
 We will continue to build relationships internally and across our bioregion in support of developing a cohesive bioregional regeneration strategy. We envision a truly just transition to a thriving, regenerative future for all inhabitants, reweaving the tapestry of the lands and waterways of Northeast.
 
 The funds raised from this grant will support organizing and strategic planning, toward the following next steps:
 * Form a clear vision and mission statement for focused, coherent coordination.
 * Establish governance structures in partnership with regional intertribal alliances, providing a framework for coordinating bioregional regeneration efforts.
 * Organization forms we‚Äôve discussed to date included federated cooperatives and a Bioregional Trust.
 * Map out existing and emergent initiatives within the bioregion.
 * Host in-person and digital gatherings with partners to refine strategies, governance structures, and funding models for coordinating bioregional regeneration efforts.
 * We will gradually increase in convening scale and/or diversify to specific working groups as coherence forms.
 * Deepen co-presencing and co-learning building on our current practices of engaging within our team, other regions and beyond human kin to further expand our collective capacity
 * Identify and pursue further resources to support organizing and partner work to promote ecosystem health and community resilience
 * Develop a network of bioregional learning centers/hubs to help communities deepen their connection to place, cultivate coherence and a shared understanding of bioregional engagement, and co-create knowledge commons.
 
 As we form our Bioregional Financing Facility, we are drawing upon the deep experience and wealth of this bioregion, to craft truly regenerative circular bioeconomies and the cultural and governance structures to achieve systemic transformation of capitalism.

 Project Description:
 Washika DAO is a framework and protocol aimed at transforming governance and financial inclusion for marginalized communities such as Village Community Banks (VICOBAs), Savings and Credit Cooperative Societies (SACCOS), and Chamas across communities in Tanzania and Kenya. Built on the Celo blockchain and leveraging the use of stablecoins, Washika DAO provides a robust platform for savings, lending, and governance, designed to empower communities and promote sustainable economic growth.
 
 Issues We‚Äôre Tackling
 In emerging markets, access to credit remains a critical barrier to economic growth and financial inclusion. Traditional banking systems often fail to serve the needs of small businesses and individuals, especially those in low-income earning communities. Despite the progress in making banking services accessible√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùsuch as banking the unbanked with a basic feature phone and an ID√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùbarriers to credit access continue to impede financial empowerment. High-interest rates, stringent lending requirements, and limited financial literacy are significant challenges. 
 
 Our focus is on scalable solutions that integrate innovation with existing community practices, such as the Washika DAO protocol, to create sustainable economic growth and resilience, while critically assessing the trade-offs and impacts on marginalized communities. By examining the potential of novel credit systems to empower local economies, enhance financial autonomy, and reduce dependency on conventional traditional structures.
 
 Our paper explores innovative approaches to credit delivery, leveraging decentralized finance (DeFi) technologies and community-driven models. Central to this exploration is the question:
  At what cost are marginalized communities truly financially included?
 
 - Financial Exclusion: Millions of people in marginalized communities lack access to basic financial services. Washika DAO provides an inclusive platform that empowers these communities through alternative means to financing in DeFi.
 - Lack of Transparency: Traditional financial systems often suffer from opacity and corruption. Our blockchain-based solution ensures all transactions and decisions are transparent and immutable as well as all governance decisions stored onchain for transparency and proper record keeping.
 - High Transaction Costs: By leveraging decentralized finance (DeFi) principles and stablecoins utilities, we significantly reduce the cost of transactions, making financial services more affordable for marginalized communities facing high transaction costs.
 - Inefficient Lending Processes: Traditional lending processes can be slow and bureaucratic. Washika DAO automates and streamlines the process, providing quick and fair access to credit.
 
 
 Governance
 - At the heart of Washika DAO is a decentralized governance model that ensures all members have a voice in the decision-making process. Any existing Chama can create a DAO in 3 simple steps, adding relevant fields such as members, multisig holders etc. without having to worry about web3. Anyone in the DAO is also able to put up a proposal reviewed by all at anytime. Key features include:
 - Democratic Voting: Members can propose and vote on changes to the protocol, interest rates, loan terms, and other critical decisions.
 - Transparent Operations: All governance activities are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and accountability.
 - Community-driven Proposals: Any member can submit proposals, fostering a collaborative environment where the best ideas can flourish.
 
 [![create-dao.png](https://i.postimg.cc/FztPHN97/create-dao.png)](https://postimg.cc/34BjLM0T)
 
 
 Savings:
 Communities already operate a savings pool offchain through a model known as ‚ÄúMchezo'' in Swahili, where the funds pooled shift hands every month. Washika DAO‚Äôs savings mechanism is designed to encourage financial discipline and provide a safe, transparent way to save money:
 - Secure & TransparentSavings Accounts: Members can open savings accounts that are securely managed by smart contracts. The balances will be scraped from their existing holding accounts such as bank / mobile money wallet (M-Pesa)
 - Interest Earnings: Savings pooled in the DAO earn interest, which is distributed back to the members proportionally. This adds value to the idle funds sat in their pool/ bank account.
 - Automated Management: In the near future, Smart contracts automate the process of interest calculation and distribution, ensuring efficiency and accuracy.
 
 [![balance.png](https://i.postimg.cc/pT5GvpMw/balance.png)](https://postimg.cc/Pphzzfxy)
 
 Lending:
 - Washika DAO revolutionizes the traditional lending process with a decentralized, community-focused approach:
 - Peer-to-Peer & Group Lending: Members can apply for loans that are funded directly by the community‚Äôs pooled savings. Communities can also collectively apply for a loan at better terms through a collateralized asset, such as liquid bond in this case.
 - Fair Loan Terms: Loans are granted based on predefined criteria, ensuring fairness and reducing the risk of default.
 
 - Automated Repayments: Repayment schedules are managed by smart contracts, making the process seamless and reliable.
 
 What We‚Äôre Building:
 Comprehensive Governance & Financial Platform: A user-friendly interface for participating in governance, transparency in managing of funds and savings as well as applying for cost-efficient loans through alternative means of financing.
 
 Blockchain Integration: A protocol to ensure governance security and transparency for these communities, alternative means of financing utility in stablecoin settlements & store of value and efficiency. We are also making the User experience as friendly as possible by mapping their wallets in the backend to their mobile phone numbers and linking their National IDs. This will also enable tracking of history and records.
 
 Educational Resources: Providing training and support to help members understand and effectively use the platform. This includes a DAO toolkit, all accessible in English and Swahili local language.
 
 Community Tools: Features to facilitate collaboration, knowledge sharing, and collective decision-making.

However, they often lack the resources to take meaningful action, making them entirely dependent on the decisions of other countries.
 
 It is estimated that an annual investment of $5 trillion is needed to combat climate change. Of this figure, emerging and developing countries (EMDEs) need $2 trillion annually, a fivefold increase from 2020 (IMF, 2023).
 
 Without the right infrastructure to coordinate such significant budgets, it's unlikely that EMDEs will be able to attract $2 trillion annually and take the required actions.
 
 Local NGOs, businesses, and individuals in these EMDEs must be included in the solution to increase the socioeconomic support base for such action. Kolektivo allows local stakeholders to leverage their positive impact to start local impact-driven economies that regenerate communities and nature. 
 
 **Progress since GG21**
 * Made significant progress with our Web Application. About to start internal UX testing with the aim to finalize development by end of October.
 * Hosted three climate action days with Wa Samaki to test our Mobile Application.
 * Added additional features to our Mobile Application.
 * Started researching and testing an Optimistic impact measurement approach using Hypercerts.
 
 Kolektivo combines a web platform for stakeholders and a mobile app for individuals to create local impact economies based on the positive impact created.

 ‚öîÔ∏è THE CHALLENGES
 The power of Web3 has yet to be fully realised in climate action as many of these technologies remain disconnected from communities on-the-ground. Access to funding, expertise, and technology is a major challenge - particularly in the Global South‚Äôs rural and indigenous communities who have massive potential to expand biodiversity protection and commons stewardship, but lack management resources, market access and funding to grow initiatives and purchase their land (often back) for conservation, reforestation, regeneration and food security. 
 
 
 Establishing standards for monitoring and evaluating climate change mitigation efforts is expensive, with high barriers and up front costs for carbon accounting, biodiversity monitoring, oracles and dMRV to issue carbon and biodiversity credits for climate resilience. https://medium.com/kolektivo-co/monitoring-reporting-and-verification-methodologies-in-regenerative-finance-81d76cb9710
 
 
 There is also a huge learning and technology curve to gain access to funding and eco credit markets, and many existing institutional programs that work with these communities are inefficient and corrupt, provide under market value, and lack transparency in funding flows and impact accounting. 
 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257721886_Problematizing_REDD_as_an_experiment_in_payments_for_ecosystem_services
 
 
 Most financing is also exogenous and does not maintain value and circulation within these communities, who remain dependent on external economic injections.

 üåç ACTIVATING BIOREGIONAL REGENERATION THROUGH ECOCREDITS
 The Global Green Finance Market Size is expected to reach USD 28.71 Trillion by 2033, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 21.25 percent during the forecast period 2023 to 2033 (Spherical Insights). One growing asset class, ecocredits, has emerged as a bioregional financing mechanism poised to support financing the transition to regenerative agriculture, biodiversity protection, and other environmental justice initiatives. Unlike carbon credits, ecocredits allow for an expanded and more holistic representation of ecological dimensions and ecosystem service value flows that can be stacked to create co-benefits and more systemic representations and nature-based solutions for environmental stewardship and conservation.
 https://shorturl.at/W1TF7 
 https://shorturl.at/n6vFX 
 https://carboncopy.news/features/unlocking-blockchain-solutions-protect-latin-america-latam-biodiversity/ 
 We aim to make these tools accessible to farmers, regenerative land projects, and indigenous communities that have been protecting our forests, the global heritage of medicinal plants, and traditional ways of farming, producing, and organising life, being critical to the success of nature-based solutions to climate change mitigation, such as improved forest management practices and ecosystem protection. https://www.facetsjournal.com/doi/10.1139/facets-2019-0058. 
 
 With scientifically rigorous work in ecocredit methodology development, experience in platform and technology analysis, and holding key partnerships, this group is uniquely positioned to catalyze process creation and onboarding for ecocredit issuance and sales relationships. Using this financing mechanism, we aim to support and horizontally scale regenerative land-based projects that increase biodiversity, restore soil health, uplift marginalized communities, and build reciprocal relationships with land and life, human and non-human.
 
 
 üåä VISION & GOALS
 Maintain and regenerate the conditions for life
 To bridge intersectional regeneration and Web3 to guard precious ecosystems and ancestral cultures 
 Leveraging existing methodologies to financially incentivize transitioning to regenerative practices, holistic management, and bioregional regeneration 
 Develop ecocredit pilots and the foundations to issue and sell ecocredits to finance bioregional regeneration
 To improve methodologies for measuring and reporting ecological systems health
 Capacity building and endogenous value creation for land stewardship, environmental justice, protection and regeneration of water, biodiversity, soil, food systems, and communities
 Attract investors and sponsors interested in partnering in education, financing, and scaling bioregional regeneration initiatives
 Our vision is to secure funding for this vital project that contributes to intersectional ecological restoration and climate action. By protecting natural (endangered) sites and co-developing ecocredits in allyship with land-based communities, we aim to foster regenerative practice and holistic management to protect and increase biodiversity. We also aim to support and continue to enable the integration of ancestral land practices and ‚ÄúWestern‚Äù science methodologies, also known as ‚ÄúTwo-Eyed Seeing‚Äù in Eskasoni and Acadia Nation traditions.
 Regeneration goes beyond agriculture and the environment. It has principles, not recipes. Regenerative solutions need to be contextually applied in different bioregions. This creates the conditions for emergent solutions that increase biodiversity, regenerate soils and landscapes, and improve community health and wellbeing. 
 üå≥ THE MISSION 
 Supporting the expansion of community-led biodiversity conservation by lowering the barriers to access and co-developing guides for Web3 tech, financing, eco credits, the creation of complementary currencies to build economic, cultural, and climate resilience.
 Project milestones include:
 
 
 Ecocredit pilot initialization for two land nodes
 Assess feasibility and gather data for holistic ecosystem services financing to support cattle ranchers in transitioning to regenerative cattle grazing
 Assess feasibility and gather data for Voluntary Biodiversity credit issuance with land partners and farmers
 Documentation of the pilot process for iteration, refinement, and replication to produce the foundations for rapid scaling
 Pilot corporate partnerships for the development of commercial transactions and investments in ecocredit sales to support long-term financial sustainability for the incubator, transition financing for land partners, and funding for ongoing R&D and allied institutions apprenticeship training
 Replicable process for ecocredit development
 Pre-structure, simplified mechanisms to channel from investor/channel 
 Training reporting/verification - capacity builiding 
 Organizational development e.g. rancher ecocredit cooperatives and market building in Costa Rica and in global markets
 Support the expansion of land preservation with the issuance of high-quality ecocredits via dMRV and oracle partnerships where the investment stays within the communities and helps reduce GHG emissions and preserve biodiversity. 
 Support the repurchase, preservation, and regeneration of degraded land, especially on the edges of indigenous territories to expand the ‚Äúbuffer‚Äù amidst increasing development pressure. 
 üíö WHO WE SERVE
 Land stewards and conservationists including indigenous and rural communities
 The land and all non-human kin
 üé• THE GRANT WORK WILL RESULT IN:
 In order to support the scale needed, Landia and partners will pilot ecocredit development in Costa Rica, laying the foundation to onboard regenerative land projects and train UCI graduates as apprentices in the process to replicate, iterate, and scale ecocredit research and development in different bioregions around the planet. The team will undertake two pilots using existing Digital Methodology Reporting and Verification (dMRV) methodologies with future plans in innovating on methodologies to better represent ecological health. Within this scope, UCI and partners will document the learnings and refine processes for onboarding, ecocredit development, and sales with a future aim to develop courses and education to train bioregional regenerators on how to navigate and participate in these emerging markets.

 Universidad para la Cooperaci√≥n Internacional(UCI)
 The University for International Cooperation (UCI) was born in Costa Rica in 1994, as a response to the need of the Latin American and Caribbean region to have professionals with inter- and multidisciplinary training, to effectively face multifaceted challenges and dilemmas. of the complexity of the modern world, under the concepts of sustainability, regeneration, conservation, and globalization.
 
 UCI is clear about its responsibility to contribute to training leaders who promote an intelligent global society, capable of addressing reality with a holistic vision, and more integrative of different knowledge: academic and scientific rigor on which the paradigms of scientific development are based. UCI embraces current technology, but with values ‚Äã‚Äãand attitudes that build social responsibility, balance with nature and formation of a more supportive and more inclusive society. 
 Website: https://uci.ac.cr/en/home_en 
 
 UCI has been implementing regenerative grazing for three years through its Savory Hub. Adding to the known benefits of the Savory method, UCI added the increase of biodiversity by giving back between 15 to 30 percent of pasture areas to nature through the establishment of biological corridors. This has increased revenue for farmers, allowed for water harvest and early indicators show an important potential to increase biodiversity. 
 Now, these efforts have been extended to 30,000 hectares with support from rePLANET.org. The current focus of this project is carbon with ‚Äúadditional‚Äù benefits for biodiversity. The intention of developing ecocredits is to be able to finance biodiversity regeneration directly, transitioning from carbon-tunnel vision.

 Hedging against Impermanent Loss smart contracts is a simple tool that will enable AMM liquidity providers to hedge against Impermanent Loss. In today's high-volatility and price-uncertain environment, the need for effective risk management tools is more critical than ever.
 
 **Carmine Finance has a simple goal. Take care of crypto risk.**
 
 The team behind Carmine Finance has been building risk management solutions for a couple years. Right now we are working on a smart contract that will hedge Impermanent loss and will enable the community to manage this risk and mainly build novel solutions on top of it thanks to the composability in DeFi.
 
 The smart contract that will allow for hedging the Impermanent Loss will be built as a portfolio of options that has an opposite P&L curve to the Impermanent Loss. Because of the discreteness of options‚Äô strike prices the hedge will not be perfect.
 
 The initial version will cover Impermanent Loss of constant product function AMMs and the consequential versions will allow for a more generic version that will cover concentrated liquidity AMMs. 
 
 ### Example Implementation:
 
 For example, consider a user who is providing liquidity to an AMM on Polygon. The objective is to offer a B2B2C solution with the AMM, allowing the user to hedge against impermanent loss directly. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how it works:
 1) **User Interaction**: As the user engages with the AMM, they are presented with an option to hedge against impermanent loss, seamlessly integrated within the AMM‚Äôs interface.
 2) **Hedge Purchase**: The user decides to purchase the IL hedge. Behind the scenes, this process is efficiently managed to ensure ease of use.
 3) **Cross-Chain Operation**: Funds are securely bridged from Polygon to Starknet. Once on Starknet, the IL hedge is executed using specialized smart contracts.
 4) **Tokenization and Bridging**: The user receives an IL hedge token representing their hedged position. This token is then bridged back to the user's wallet on Polygon, enabling them to manage their hedge directly from their wallet.
 
 Carmine Finance team has been working on and delivering on following projects
 - **DeRisk:** A platform that facilitates independent risk monitoring and mitigation strategies, enabling users to safeguard their digital assets proactively.
 - **Options AMM:** A foundational tool for the community to create diverse hedging products, allowing for flexible risk coverage tailored to their needs.
 - **Konoha:** Governance framework that is an accessible and customizable system that empowers any Starknet protocol to innovate with token creation, distribution, and staking, reinforcing community-led governance.""",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/608/145

 It is an onchain, competitive/gamified grants platform available for use by Arbitrum DAO.
 
 ### Where did it come from? 
 Grant Ships was made possible through a grant from Arbitrum Foundation via Plurality Labs & Thrive. It is being developed by [The DAO Masons](https://www.x.com/daomasons).
 
 Grant Ships has since received a followup grant through the Thank Arb Firestarters program for additional development. 
 
 ### How do we know it works? 
 
 We tested it with a 90K ARB pilot funding program. Three 'ship operator' teams competed to best allocate their portion of the funds within the ""Web3 Gaming on Arbitrum"" funding domain. 
 
 ### Evolution in Action
 Grant Ships is built on the premise that explicit and visible competition, accountability and selection pressure on grants programs will force them to mature into something that is both effective and aligned with the desires of the DAO.
 
 ### Pilot Overview
 A detailed, graphical breakdown where we grade our performance on each of these 4 aspects of the Flywheel is available in our [Pilot Restrospective PDF](https://grantships.fun/pilotretro.pdf) - it is worth a scroll.

 ## Geist dApp kit
 Optimized dApp Components that you or LLM can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible, Localized. Customizable. Open Source. Inspired by shadcn/ui.
 
 This is not a framework / template. This is more like a cookbook, with very different design principles(below).
 
 There was an incident and [we had to ""Stop Using Dapps""](https://decrypt.co/209804/ledger-library-compromised-with-wallet-drainer). We want to avoid that.
 
 We're working on this dApp kit not only to improve developer experience by providing working examples and decouple styling/implementation, but also to support dapps that are trustless, secure with minimal dependency to particular ecosystems and avoid supply chain attakcs. This is pivotal to support AI autonomous agents to control and iterate on Decentralized, autonomous website with programmable cryptography, which the project `Geist` focus on. 
 
 ## WTF is Geist
 
 Geist is a decentralized website builder for DAOs, enabling trustless zk-proof deployments, private previews, and anti-collusion voting. It supports collaboration and censorship-resistant websites.
 
 At ETHGlobal Singapore, we prototyped the idea and were [awarded the üèÜFinalist](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/geist-x3fur)
 
 Vitalik mentioned ""walkaway test"" and ""insider attack test"" for better [Ethereum Alignment](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/09/28/alignment.html?ref=blockhead.co). We want to help people build dWebsites which align that. 
 
 DApp kit is where we start, and we want to further build the e2e CMS solution. 
 
 ## dApp kit Design principles
 üîª Minimized dependencies, familiar techstack. No ethers by default, all in viem wagmi permissionless radix tailwindcss, user controls the rest.
 üèé Optimized and SSR ready. Unified data fetching with unopionated data source, minimized JS
 ü§å Small. Faster for both user and ci. Cheaper to store.
 üîí Secure. No dynamic script loading. Audited dependencies (TODO)
 üïäÔ∏è Censorship Resistant. Take explicit control on asset gateway and trust assumptions
 üåê Accessible & Localization ready
 ‚õìÔ∏è Ecosystems, Framework agnostic
 üôå Working example. First class Storybook support, avoid outdated documentations.
 üö∂ Open source. Authors can walkaway. No npm account to secure.
 
 ## Current State
 - We have been prototyping, and this is a [rough demo for receips on storybook](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/caa51b75-4f0c-478a-be5b-cfe69f9f9457)
 - Feature we've built and polishing
  - common react components (e.g. resolve ENS names)
  - Demo on EIP191/EIP721 signing with `viem` / `micro-eth-signer`
  - wagmi-based, alternative, treeshake-able client to Ethereum Attestation Service
  - upload widgets to upload files to Filecoin
  - Avatar components with explicit ipfs gateway control (for censorship-resistance)
 
 ## Roadmap
 - For now, focus is to build 100+ working receipes and identify best practices (e.g. Gql loading, component structure)
 - We plan to launch alpha version with 
  - working storybook to receive community feedback
  - shadcn cli compatibility

 * Outcomes already achieved by organizations are recorded as hypercerts on OP mainnet
 
 * Donors can directly buy the outcomes they think are impactful, putting the focus on work done rather than the organization doing the work
 
 * Each outcome has a fixed price to prevent donors from overpaying. On VoiceDeck, organizations cannot raise more money than the impact they have created
 
 * Since launching on October 18 2024, we have had $53 in purchases from 6 donors to support civic activists in India with a history of outcomes
 
 **Integration with Allo Protocol**
 
 We want to take our MVP for outcome based funding in journalism as a custom strategy on Allo protocol with the following features
 
 * Applicants list past outcomes they have created and the cost incurred to achieve that outcome in the application form to the round
 
 
 * Round operator converts those outcomes into hypercerts
 
 
 * Badgeholders choose the hypercerts they feel are valuable, see the price it needs to be fully funded, and make a decision on whether to allocate money for purchasing any of its units
 
 **Benefits**
 
 * Separates the organization from the outcome that is chosen for funding, alleviating criticism of retro rounds being a popularity contest and brand value being the most important
 
 
 * Creates a variable fundraising cap for each organization based on how many outcomes they list and the price of each outcome listed. 
 
 Example: organization A lists 2 outcomes that cost them $100 and $1000 to achieve. They can raise at most $1100 in the round if both hypercerts of theirs get fully funded by badgeholders
 
 * Lends itself well to external (paid) evaluators who can provide attestations on the value of those outcomes for context to badgeholders. 
 
 We want a self-regulating mechanism where organizations don't list the cost of achieving the outcome too high since that lowers the impact score (the same outcome is less valuable if it costs more money to achieve it). And they don‚Äôt list the cost as too low since that would reduce the price of the hypercert and the eligible funding they can receive in the round.
 
 * Organizations must create new outcomes from money raised to be eligible in future rounds. If a hypercert gets fully funded, they can't list it again in future rounds
 
 **Drawbacks**
 
 * Requires a heavier lift from organizations, who have to think carefully about what outcomes they are proud of and estimate the cost of achieving that outcome
 
 * Ideally requires some verification of listed outcomes and also the costs of the outcome
 
 * Limits the total amount of funding the project receives to the outcomes they have created
 
 * Might be confusing for badgeholders or donors since they don‚Äôt have to judge organizations but what outcomes were worthy 
 
 **Use of Funds**
 
 * Feedback from round operators and community rounds on utility of this module
 
 * Product document listing out requirements
 
 * Payment to developer for integrating outcome based funding via hypercerts with Allo
 
 *This work is a collaboration between Holke Brammer and bitbeckers from the Hypercerts foundation, Sejal Rekhan from Gitcoin and Devansh Mehta from VoiceDeck*",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/636/15

 Founded in 2017, the **Amazon Sacred Headwaters Alliance (ASHA)** is an Indigenous-led alliance seeking to permanently protect more than **86 million acres** of tropical rainforests in the headwaters of the mighty Amazon River‚Äîthe Napo, Pastaza, and Mara√±on Basins of Ecuador and Peru. The initiative has been building a shared long-term vision, capacity, and alliances for the designation of a bi-national protected region off-limits to industrial-scale resource extraction under Indigenous peoples' stewardship. We are advancing stronger Indigenous territorial rights while working to shift the dominant paradigm from the pursuit of economic growth and industrial development to a regenerative standing forest economy centered on the wellbeing of communities and the ecological integrity of the bioregion.
 
 ![CSMAPA](https://i.postimg.cc/BnwXWK69/CSMAPA.png)
 
 ## The Amazon Rainforest at the Tipping Point
 
 The Amazon Basin, the Earth‚Äôs largest rainforest‚Äîhome to 500+ Indigenous nations and unparalleled biodiversity‚Äîis reaching a tipping point of no return. Forest and biodiversity loss continue as a result of extractive pursuits carried out in the name of development such as mining, oil drilling, logging, and industrial agriculture.
 
 The Amazon rainforest drives atmospheric rivers essential for the circulation of rainfall around the planet. The forest also sequesters carbon, regulates local and global weather patterns, and cools the climate. Scientists warn that the Amazon‚Äôs hydrological system is unraveling due to deforestation, and that this will likely trigger a massive forest dieback within decades unless we move urgently to protect and restore 80 percent of the Amazon‚Äôs forest cover.
 
 ## About the Amazon Sacred Headwaters Alliance
 
 The Indigenous peoples of the Amazon Sacred Headwaters region joined forces in 2017 and gave birth to the **Amazon Sacred Headwaters Alliance (ASHA)**‚Äîan initiative with the goal of protecting our rainforest territories, united by the common understanding that we all belong to an interconnected web of rivers and forests, and that we are all kin. When we unite, we can better protect our lands and our rights.
 
 ASHA emerges as one of the world‚Äôs largest Indigenous-led forest protection initiatives. We are an alliance of **30 Indigenous nations and peoples** in Ecuador and Peru with a shared vision of permanently protecting **86 million acres** of bio-culturally diverse tropical rainforests (an area larger than Italy) in the headwaters of the mighty Amazon River, in the Napo, Pastaza, and Mara√±on Basins.
 
 ![Cuencas sagradas](https://i.postimg.cc/BZDDxMv8/Cuencas-sagradas.jpg)
 
 ## ASHA‚Äôs Key Funding Priorities
 
 With Indigenous leadership at the helm, the Alliance is mobilizing and channeling funding to:
 
 - **Strengthen institutional capacity** of Indigenous member organizations for territorial governance, advocacy, project implementation, and financial management;
 - **Secure funding** to support Indigenous-led initiatives for food security, livelihood alternatives, forest monitoring, intercultural health/education, and renewable energy;
 - **Accompany and support** the pilot reforestation project and the Amazon Living School;
 - **Launch** the monitoring and evaluation system and the GIS platform, and design a project portfolio platform showcasing priority initiatives;
 - **Organize or participate** in joint communications/advocacy campaigns and legal actions to deter extractive industries and defend Indigenous rights and the rights of nature;
 - **Advance legal recognition** of Indigenous land claims covering 22 million acres of rainforests; and
 - **Propose systemic solutions** to incentivize forest protection and halt deforestation (canceling debt, wellbeing indicators, universal basic/intact forest income, bioeconomy hubs).
 
 ![Climate Week](https://i.postimg.cc/pXwTVHvy/climateweek.jpg)
 
 ## Our Theory of Change
 
 For millennia, Indigenous peoples have demonstrated that it is possible to live in harmony with nature and in kinship with all life. Some of the best-preserved regions on Earth are areas inhabited by Indigenous peoples, boasting 80 percent of the world‚Äôs terrestrial biodiversity and half of the world‚Äôs intact forests. Solutions emerging from our collective processes as communities and territories are rooted in our culture and traditional ecological knowledge.
 
 While Indigenous stewardship has been shown to be key to the success of forest protection efforts, less than 1% of pledged climate funding reaches Indigenous territories. Through this Alliance, we are joining together to mobilize significant financial and technical resources to ensure that our voices are heard, our rights are recognized, and our territories are protected.
 
 For the governments of Ecuador and Peru to forgo their industrial ambitions for the Amazon, they must be persuaded to understand that protecting this bioregion is a win-win-win for Indigenous peoples, the Earth‚Äôs biosphere, and their nations‚Äô long-term economic prosperity. It is our premise that significant levels of international funding, investments, and financial mechanisms (e.g., debt forgiveness, climate and biodiversity adaptation and mitigation funds, philanthropy) can be mobilized and leveraged to incentivize the protection of the Sacred Headwaters region.
 
 What happens in the Amazon Headwaters ripples throughout the basin. It is urgent to shift to a new paradigm of well-being and harmony where the bioregion, the territories, cultures, biodiversity, and the regenerative economy are mutually flourishing.

 Since 2017, our Alliance has grown to **27 member organizations**, of which **24 are Indigenous organizations**. Our governance structure has been evolving to ensure ample transparency, sound governance, and meaningful participation by member organizations.
 
 ASHA‚Äôs work is facilitated by a **Technical Secretariat**. The Secretariat provides technical, financial, and administrative support to the Alliance and coordinates various working groups focused on planning, fundraising, project implementation, evaluation, and advocacy. The Alliance is further guided by a council of Indigenous wisdom keepers and a global commission of experts.
 
 Since its inception, the Technical Secretariat has been housed at **Fundaci√≥n Pachamama**. In July 2023, ASHA embarked on its next chapter and began a process of transitioning its operations to a new Indigenous-led nonprofit entity legally incorporated in Ecuador, under its Spanish name **‚ÄúAlianza Cuencas Sagradas Amaz√≥nicas‚Äù**. The newly incorporated Alliance is governed by the **General Assembly of Members** (formerly called the Governing Council), which is composed of representatives of the 27 member organizations. The General Assembly meets in person twice a year to determine strategic priorities.
 
 The following are the elected board of directors for the **2023-2026** period:
 
 - **Founding member & Alliance President of the Board:** Uyunkar Domingo Peas Nampichkai (Achuar)
 - **Founding member & Alliance Vice President:** Wrayz Perez (Wampis Nation)
 - **Founding member:** Jorge Perez (AIDESEP)
 - **Founding member:** Lolita Piaguaje (CONFENIAE)
 - **COICA Representative:** *(vacant, TBD)*
 - **Lourdes Jipa** (Naci√≥n Quijos)
 - **Elaine Shajian Shawit** (CORPI)
 - **Olivia Bisa** (GTA Chapra)
 - **Sa√∫l Calapucha** (PAKKIRU)
 - **Bel√©n P√°ez** (Fundaci√≥n Pachamama)
 - **Kim Chaix** (Rainforest Foundation US)

 # Additional Information
 
 **Please describe your project's mission and values.**
 
 One of the world‚Äôs largest Indigenous-led conservation initiatives, the **Amazon Sacred Headwaters Alliance (ASHA)** has unified **30 Indigenous nations** of Ecuador and Peru, collectively advocating for the protection of **86 million acres** of highly bioculturally diverse tropical rainforests‚Äîan area the size of Italy.
 
 Indigenous peoples have demonstrated a profound ability to live harmoniously with nature. They have maintained the Earth's most pristine regions containing an astounding **80 percent** of the planet's terrestrial biodiversity and half of its remaining intact forests. ASHA‚Äôs solutions, derived through communal and territorial processes, are firmly rooted in traditional ecological knowledge. While Indigenous stewardship has been shown to be key to the success of forest protection efforts, very little conservation and climate mitigation funding reaches Indigenous territories. Through this Alliance, we are joining our efforts to mobilize significant financial and technical resources to amplify our voices, reforest lands, secure the recognition of our rights, and safeguard our territories.
 
 ### What is the location of your land project?
 
 Ecuadorian and Peruvian Amazon‚Äîthe Sacred Headwaters bioregion.
 
 ### Summarize the regenerative activities you are engaged in.
 
 ASHA‚Äôs regenerative activities include securing funding to support:
 
 - Indigenous-led food security initiatives
 - Livelihood alternatives
 - Forest monitoring
 - Intercultural health and education programs
 - Reforestation projects
 - The Living Amazon School (**EVA**)
 
 Additionally, we advance legal recognition of land claims covering **22 million acres** of rainforests while working to propose systemic solutions to incentivize forest protection and halt deforestation:
 
 - Canceling debt
 - Wellbeing indicators
 - Universal basic/intact forest income
 - Bioeconomy hubs
 
 ![Other](https://sacredheadwaters.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Manari-and-sky-1.jpg)
 
 ### What particular initiatives will these funds support?
 
 Support will advance our efforts to:
 
 - **Bolster food security** for land stewards by:
  - Reducing malnutrition
  - Increasing food production through sustainable agroforestry
  - Community education on nutrition and sustainable practices
 - **Contribute to the Living Amazon School (EVA)**, a program designed to help the next generation of young Indigenous leaders in the Ecuadorian Amazon with technical assistance and training
 - **Provide general capacity-building support** to train Indigenous team members on advocacy, communications, and territorial coordination
 
 ![Other](https://sacredheadwaters.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Rainforest-above.jpg)
 
 ### How will/do you measure or determine the impact of your efforts?
 
 An adaptive **Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (ME&L) system** has been designed and is being tested to carry out the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of our interventions and to measure our impact towards our bioregional plan and systems change goals. The Secretariat produces quarterly and annual reports to present our progress and challenges in relation to the priorities set by ASHA‚Äôs General Assembly.
 
 Currently, our Alliance holds retreats 1 to 2 times per year with its various bodies (members‚Äô assembly, Secretariat staff, and board) to collectively review and evaluate our successes, failures, and the latest developments in order to harvest our learnings and set priorities. Our methods of evaluation have been mostly qualitative, and on occasion, our advocacy and legal actions report clear outcomes:
 
 - Halting mining or oil drilling
 - Upholding Indigenous rights
 - Defeating harmful legislation
 - Public actions such as the Yasuni referendum
 
 We have also developed a novel framework and metrics for specific projects such as the **Living Amazon School (EVA)** related to Indigenous youth developing leadership and technical skills to monitor their ancestral territories and a dashboard of results for the reforestation program.
 
 The Communications department at ASHA does extensive work by recording the reach of specific campaigns and events, compiling this information in an extensive communications report (in Spanish) that can be provided upon request. This report includes:
 
 - Social media reach and impressions
 - Attendance at online events
 - Mentions in the media
 - Articles where ASHA is featured
 
 Even so, our monitoring, learning, and evaluation systems across all of our programs need further development.
 
 In response to this need, ASHA‚Äôs **Research and Learning working group** was established in late 2022 to enhance our understanding of our Alliance‚Äôs impact on the Amazon Sacred Headwaters bioregion. This group has produced and proposed a number of tools and processes that, once fully implemented, would enhance our Alliance‚Äôs capabilities to ask the right questions and gather both quantitative and qualitative information to be able to ""see"" and evaluate the system's dynamics and trends and the impact of our interventions, identifying how we could adapt and learn from these patterns to more effectively deliver our mission to protect the headwaters.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/18/15
GG22,GG22 OSS - dApps and Apps,authbond,0x665489da2EDfF3e9Ffc4abd7C6A5093eda7d42E8,https://twitter.com/acurraent,https://github.com/Consortium-WIDE,authbond,https://wid3.xyz/projects/authbond,APPROVED,"## Introduction to authbond
 
 authbond, tackles the issue of accountability in Web3 contracting, where pseudonymity can lead to delivery challenges. Traditional bid bonds effectively mitigate risks of project defaults in conventional contracting but have not been widely applied in the Web3 space. authbond innovates by incorporating privacy-preserving Know Your Business (KYB) confirmations and bid bond deposits into reusable on-chain identities, enhancing trust and transparency in digital trade.
 
 The platform enables organisations to issue Requests for Proposals (RFPs) with defined selection criteria. Applicants can import their business data and submit proposals, which are then linked to privacy-preserving ID-NFTs. These NFTs verify KYB completion and represent the bid bond, ensuring that only complete and verified proposals are considered. This process reduces the risk of financial losses and increases procurement efficiency. authbond leverages eIDAS 2.0-based identities and integrates with existing solutions like F6S and Priv√©, ensuring compliance with MiCA outsourcing regulations and establishing provenance for proceeds. 
 
 Using privacy-preserving ID-NFTs by authbond incentivises honest data provision while protecting user privacy. The platform also promotes trust through intermediated interoperability, benefiting Europe's digital economy and virtual commerce. This approach democratises access to on-chain economies, allowing DAO contributors to use real-world identities for Web3 work opportunities.
 
 
 ## Motivation
 
 authbond addresses key issues in Web3 contracting by tackling free-riding and improving financial security. Current Web3 contracting methods don‚Äôt comply with MiCA regulations or verify contractor identities effectively. Many foundations struggle to trust the contractors they‚Äôre funding because it‚Äôs hard to verify their liquidity, past performance, or business legitimacy. authbond integrates KYB and bid bonds into on-chain identities, allowing verified commitments and compliance, which increases trust between funders and contractors.
 
 ## Potential Demonstration Scenario
 
 For example, Foundation X issues an RFP using authbond. Contractors verify their identity with eIDAS 2.0-compliant KYB, then submit proposals and deposit bid bonds in the form of ID-NFTs. Foundation X reviews verified proposals and uses smart contracts to handle bid bonds, ensuring compliance and security throughout the process.

DAOs by facilitating async communication on platforms like Telegram and Discord as well as on web3. Using Generative AI and a conversational UX, the tool allows for 1:1 interactions with participants to gather and synthesize responses, thereby speeding up the co-creation of artifacts like proposals, OKRs, RFPs, roadmaps and strategy documents without the need for direct group discussions. This reduces conflict and improves engagement by allowing participants to express candid opinions and achieve alignment more efficiently.
 
 **Problem:** Harmonica targets the critical and underserved challenge of sense-making within decentralized organisations. Traditional methods, which rely heavily on the facilitation skills of a few, are time-consuming and often leave many participants feeling overlooked, thus limiting organizational agility and effective decision-making.
 
 **Solution:** By integrating AI with a conversational UX, Harmonica automates the initial stages of sense-making. This allows for a more inclusive and efficient process, where more individuals can participate without the time constraints and interpersonal conflicts typical of standard meetings.
 
 ### **Specific Project to be Funded: Developing a Template Generator**
 
 **Project Description:** The specific project that seeks funding is focused on the development of an AI-powered facilitation template generator. This tool will enable teams to create customized facilitation templates that reflect their unique meeting and collaboration styles. Once generated, these templates can be deployed on the Harmonica platform to facilitate async meetings across various teams and groups.
 
 **Target User Group and Need:** The project primarily targets online communities and DAOs, addressing the core need for effective group decision-making. It aims to equip all participants with the tools to contribute meaningfully to strategic deliberations, thereby making the process fairer and more productive.
 
 **Sustainability and Value Delivery:** Post-funding, the project aims to become a perennial good and achieve commercial sustainability. Harmonica plans to make the core functionality available for free, allowing teams to design their own templates. Template library will be created where users can publish and monetize their templates, with revenue shared between the creators and the Harmonica platform. This model not only promotes continuous improvement and use of the best templates but also supports the platform‚Äôs long-term viability.

The bounty platform aims to reduce barriers for developers to onboard to web3 and contribute to the Ethereum ecosystem by seamlessly connecting protocols and workers. This marketplace will facilitate talent curation, work submissions and payment transfers for discrete projects, open-source contributions, and research that advances the ecosystem. By building a neutral platform, sponsors across chains and apps will be able to host on the platform and attract a large developer community to contribute work. 
 
 The Ethereum ecosystem, despite its vast potential and diverse applications, currently lacks a dedicated platform where projects can list atomic tasks in exchange for payments. This gap presents a significant opportunity to create a solution that enables projects to efficiently crowd-source specific tasks to the community, thereby accelerating development and enhancing project outcomes. Such a platform would not only streamline project workflows but also empower contributors by offering them direct compensation for their work, making participation in the ecosystem more accessible and rewarding. 
 
 2077 Bounty‚Äôs ultimate goal is onboarding new talent onto Ethereum, because people turn into lifelong evangelists if you help them earn onchain.

 NebulaID is an open-source, standardized protocol for decentralized identity verification designed to seamlessly integrate with Arbitrum blockchain and other EVM based chains. Right now, we have implemented initial version using TLS Notary, Semaphore, ZKP and Worldcoin for different types of verification for users profile. 
 
 ## Overview
 
 NebulaID introduces a novel approach to digital identity verification by combining blockchain technology with satellite networks. The protocol allows users to create and manage their digital identities across multiple platforms and blockchain networks while retaining control over their personal data. By integrating zero-knowledge proofs, NebulaID can verify user claims without revealing sensitive information, ensuring robust security and privacy. The use of Ethereum as the underlying blockchain provides a secure foundation for the protocol, enabling smart contract-based identity management that is transparent, immutable, and efficient. 
 Ideation - Developed as a response to the need for enhanced digital identity systems, the project emerged after taking inspiration from the Starship hackathon idea by SpaceX for the need of interplanteray identity verification protocol. NebulaID aims to redefine identity management by leveraging a constellation of satellites to provide blockchain-based digital IDs for individuals and assets on planet Earth and more, enhancing both security and privacy in digital transactions, health records and user nationality and other types of verification.
 
 ## Key Features and Objectives
 
 1. **Decentralized Identity Management**: NebulaID enables users to maintain control over their digital identities, supporting cross-chain compatibility and interoperability across different platforms. 
 
 2. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Privacy**: The protocol utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to verify identity-related claims without disclosing any personal information, safeguarding user privacy and data.
 
 3. **Satellite Network Integration**: By employing a network of satellites, NebulaID offers a secure, decentralized infrastructure for digital identity verification that is less prone to terrestrial risks like hacking or data breaches.
 
 4. **Multi-Planet Digital Identity**: As satellite coverage expands, NebulaID aims to provide identity verification services not just on Earth but also in space, catering to future multi-planetary digital economies.
 
 5. **Credit Verification and Scoring**: With NebulaID, users can link their digital identities to credit histories and scores, allowing for instant credit verification and evaluation. This is especially useful in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, where trust and transparency are paramount. Lenders can verify creditworthiness without accessing sensitive personal information, ensuring privacy and data security.
 
 6. **Health and Medical Records Management**: NebulaID can securely manage digital health records, enabling healthcare providers to access verified medical histories while ensuring patient confidentiality. This is vital in scenarios like medical emergencies, where quick access to accurate data can save lives. Exploring things around FHE for that purpose. 
 
 7. **Asset Management and Ownership Verification**: NebulaID facilitates secure and verifiable proof of ownership for assets such as real estate, vehicles, and digital assets. This reduces fraud and disputes in transactions involving property and other high-value items.
 
 8. **Enhanced Security and Resilience**: The integration of blockchain technology with satellite networks creates a system resistant to single points of failure, offering a highly secure and reliable digital ID solution.
 
 NebulaID directly addresses the need for a robust digital ID infrastructure by deploying a network of satellites that serve as secure nodes in a blockchain system. This architecture mitigates risks such as data breaches, cyberattacks, and identity theft, which are inherent to earthbound networks.
 
 ## System Architecture and Components
 
 1. **Blockchain Integration**: Built on Ethereum, NebulaID employs smart contracts written in Solidity to automate digital identity management, including creation, updating, access control, and revocation. The use of Ethereum ensures a permissionless environment, enhancing transparency and security.
 
 2. **Satellite Network Design**: The NebulaID satellite constellation functions as a decentralized network, where each satellite acts as a node in the blockchain system. This setup provides a resilient infrastructure for secure digital ID storage, synchronization, and verification.
 
 3. **Decentralized Storage and Transmission**: Utilizing decentralized storage solutions like IPFS, NebulaID ensures that digital IDs are stored securely and redundantly, avoiding reliance on centralized servers. Advanced encryption methods (e.g., SHA-256 and AES) are used to protect data during transmission, maintaining high levels of security.
 
 4. **Error Handling and Data Integrity**: To combat the challenges of space, such as radiation and latency, NebulaID incorporates radiation-hardened components and advanced error-correcting codes. These measures ensure data integrity and reliability, even in the harsh conditions of space.
 
 ## Future Prospects and Vision
 
 As humanity's ventures into space expand, the need for secure, scalable digital identification systems becomes increasingly critical. NebulaID positions itself as a pioneer in the convergence of blockchain technology, decentralized identity management, and satellite networks. By harnessing these innovations, NebulaID aspires to redefine the digital identity landscape for a multi-planetary future, ensuring security, privacy, and autonomy for every individual and entity involved. This project holds the potential to transform not only digital identity management on Earth but also in the emerging arena of space exploration and interplanetary transactions, contributing to the greater good of the planet and human civilization.

GG22,BioFi Pathfinders üå±,Centro Estrat√©gico de Desarrollo de la Pen√≠nsula de Osa (CEDPO),0xf26afEFcb1FD04eade3de672Af487Aaf96d5f276,https://twitter.com/,https://github.com/,Centro Estrat√©gico de Desarrollo de la Pen√≠nsula de Osa (CEDPO),https://regenerativeearth.org/osa-peninsula-regenerative-economy-lab/,APPROVED,"ABOUT THE BIOREGION
 
 The Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica, is one of the world‚Äôs biodiversity hotspots, containing 2.5% of the world‚Äôs biodiversity and inspiring National Geographic magazine to call it ‚Äúthe most biologically intense place on Earth.‚Äù The peninsula features one of the longest remaining undeveloped primary rainforests and largest mangrove wetlands on the pacific coast in Central America. The Golfo Dulce Bay is one of four tropical fjords in the world and the calving grounds of both the southern hemisphere and northern pacific humpback whales. Within its rich rainforest and coastal zones, Costa Rican culture, indigenous populations, and archeological sites reside. 
 
 Historically, the Osa Peninsula has been one of the most remote and less traveled places of Costa Rica, which has protected its abundant wildlife and culture. This is changing. In the past five years there has been increased interest in the peninsula for mass development and tourism projects, which threatens the rich biodiversity and culture that sets it apart from other regions of Costa Rica. Without proper institutional infrastructure and planning in place, these activities could lead to significant damage to the Osa's ecosystem and local culture. 
 
 In addition to this, 35% of the local population lives in severe poverty, which in turn threatens the terrestrial and marine ecosystems, as people resort to any possible means to make a living, often at the expense of the ecological wealth. Without regenerative alternatives, people have turned to destructive practices such as deforestation, poaching, mining, unsustainable agriculture, prostitution, and other illegal activities, and often end up selling their land to developers, leaving irreversible effects on the ecosystem and communities.
 
 Over the past eight years, alongside this looming threat of unsustainable development, a powerful local movement to design a regenerative economy that protects and enhances the environment, creates health and wellbeing for communities and strengthens the cultural identity of the people has emerged in the Osa Peninsula. A major reflection of this was the collaborative creation and use of the ‚ÄúRegenerative Osa Systems Map‚Äù, led by a diverse group of local leaders and a US based NGO, Regenerative Earth, in 2015. Following this was the creation of the Strategic Development Center of the Osa Peninsula (CEDPO), a partnership between the Institute of Rural Development (INDER), The Osa Territory Council (CTDR), and Regenerative Earth.
 
 THE BIOREGIONAL PROJECT HISTORY 
 
 A major asset for the Osa Peninsula is that it has a government agency, INDER (Institute of Rural Development) whose sole purpose is to assist with regional development projects. However, the capital resources of INDER are not being fully utilized as many critical projects that address poverty, conservation, and sustainable livelihoods are deemed too high risk and lacking in the appropriate technical and social capacity to receive funding. This has rendered this valuable, accessible, local source of financing as underutilized. This is also the case with Costa Rican and International Foundations and investment groups who seek to fund regenerative projects in the Osa Peninsula. Without proper support to strengthen the existing technical and social capacity, regional leaders and their potential projects may not be able to generate the critical momentum and financial backing needed to succeed in this ambitious journey.
 
 In addition to this, another major asset for the Osa Peninsula is the Osa Territorial Council, a council made up of 60% civic representation and 40% government representation with an elected representative from every community, indigenous territory, and local government agency within the Osa Territory. This governance body is responsible for creating the Osa Territorial Development Plan and selecting the projects that INDER funds. Many of these projects are the ones that INDER is not able to fund due to a lack of capacity. Through a cohesive governance body representing the diverse voices of the Osa Peninsula, the Osa Territorial Council carries the collective vision and action plan for the future of the Peninsula, providing national and international funders in the region a pathway to collaborate around a locally driven vision and plan. 
 
 Due to the above mentioned INDER, in 2020, requested that the Regenerative Earth team co-design and implement a capacity strengthening program, the Strategic Development Center of the Osa Peninsula, to strengthen the governance body of the Osa Territorial Council, develop a systems-based criteria for project selection, and develop and de-risk projects to greatly increase the quantity and quality of projects INDER and other investors can fund, to promote sustainable livelihoods based on the protection of biodiversity and preservation of local culture for this globally-significant region. 
 
 The approach recognizes that for a project (business, non-profit, organization, strategic network, or coalition) to merit funding, the teams and organizations behind them must have the capacity to assemble effective, logical, and feasible plans, and to provide confidence to funders that they can execute these plans. In the Osa Peninsula the limiting factor for projects to access funding, and for investors to find fundable projects, is this capacity. CEDPO integrates these local capacity-strengthening needs with national and international financing requirements to catalyze and strengthen a regenerative economy that is locally driven for this remarkable region.
 
 In the spring of 2022 the Osa Territorial Council (CTDR), Institute of Rural Development (INDER), and Regenerative Earth launched CEDPO with six main objectives: 
 
 1. To strengthen the capacity of the Osa Territorial Council and its ability to be an effective governance body and voice for the people of the Osa Peninsula. 
 
 2. Strengthen the capacities of locally-led projects, businesses, and alliances in the Osa Peninsula that are selected through a systems-based criteria and promote a thriving rainforest and marine ecosystem, culture, community, and regenerative economy.
 
 3. Connect projects with a broad network of universities, government Institutions, market channels, investors, and experts relevant to project needs. 
 
 4. Bridge gaps between projects seeking funds and funds seeking projects
 
 5. Design a financially-sustainable, self-sufficient and regenerative funding model for the projects and program.
 
 6. Monitor, evaluate, and learn from the program's effectiveness to inform future iterations in the Osa and in other locations globally.
 
 THE STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT CENTER OF THE OSA PENINSULA- El Centro Estrat√©gico de Desarrollo de la Pen√≠nsula de Osa (CEDPO)
 
 CEDPO is currently a partnership agreement between INDER, The Osa Territorial Council, and Regenerative Earth (a US based 501c3) with the vision to establish in the near future a Costa Rican Foundation for CEDPO. The CEDPO board of directors voting members consists of the President of the Osa Territorial Council, the Executive Director of Regenerative Earth, and the Regional Director of INDER. CEDPO has a full time paid program coordinator who is from the region, manages the program on the ground, and reports to the CEDPO board. The board of directors must have consensus in any decisions or actions taken. This allows the whole of the Osa Territorial Council and its diverse set of local and indigenous voices to be an active participant in CEDPO and to approve any actions that CEDPO takes. 
 
 Over the past three years CEDPO has strengthened the capacity of over two dozen projects that were selected by local leaders with a systems criteria and supported the Osa Territorial Council in creating its new six year territorial development plan in a way that incorporated the local citizens‚Äô vision and needs. CEDPO also connected regional and national institutions, universities, NGOs, and resources to its selected projects and initiatives and through Regenerative Earth directly granted over $169,000 to these projects.
 
 THE PROJECTS CEDPO HAS FUNDED 
 
 Below is a list of the projects CEDPO has funded through regrants. CEDPO also works with many other projects through capacity strengthening and connecting resources to those projects. 
 
 Strengthening Cultural Systems, with families from the Ng√§be Community, from the Alto Laguna territory - Total Grant Awarded: $9,000 in 2023 and $90,000 2025 - The Ng√∂be tribe lives in a territory at the heart of the Osa Peninsula and they struggle to maintain their cultural heritage. The Ng√∂be‚Äôs vision is to become food sovereign, to generate revenue through agricultural production with native seeds, develop eco and cultural tourism within their territory, strengthen an indigenous woman‚Äôs artisanal cooperative, and create a school to pass on the ancestral wisdom from the elders to the youth. 
 
 Raising Coral - Total Grant awarded: $16,000 - Raising Coral is a local organization that is researching and restoring the native coral reefs in the Golfo Dulce Bay. We supported their coral gardener training for local youth to be certified divers and to grow the coral in the Bay. 
 
 Pueblos Unidos Turismo Arqueol√≥gico - Total Grant Awarded: $15,330 - Revaluing the intangible cultural, environmental and archaeological heritage of El Progreso, Drake Bay and providing alternatives for local livelihoods to enhance the quality of life for the people and environment in the area.
 
 Aromas De Osa - Grant awarded: $15,000 - Aromas de Osa LLC is a venture that aims to promote the cultivation and distribution of natural vanilla. They are training farmers in the Osa Peninsula to grow and cultivate high quality natural vanilla in agroforestry systems and have secured an MOU with a company based in the Netherlands to market the vanilla produced and invest in a vanilla production facility in the Osa Peninsula. 
 
 Association of Artisans Collectors and Recyclers of the Osa Peninsula (ASAOSA) - Total Grants Awarded: $23,000 - Serving as the only recycling program in the Osa Peninsula. It is locally led, women driven, and incredibly under-resourced. CEDPO is supporting ASAOSA in complying with health and safety regulations, improving infrastructure and processing efficiency, educational outreach to the community, and strengthening business and financial planning.
 
 FUTURE VISION
 
 The CEDPO partners believe in the opportunity for the Osa Peninsula to be a model for the planet demonstrating world class conservation alongside sustainable livelihoods where humans and nature synergistically thrive together. With the increasing threat of climate change, these exemplar regions are needed now more than ever to inspire a new economy and way of living on the Earth. 
 
 Over the next three years CEDPO hopes to achieve six main objectives: 
 
 1. Establish a Costa Rican foundation for CEDPO run by the preexisting board of directors with potential new directors onboarded. We hope to have at least two full time employees - one social capacity strengthener and one technical capacity strengthener. We also hope that this can become a community led financing facility that generates permanent financing for capacity strengthening and project investments in the Osa Peninsula.
 
 2. Continued updating of the Regenerative Osa Systems Map to serve as a guide for project selection and territorial planning. 
 
 3. Strengthened governance body of the Osa Territorial Council to be able to effectively incorporate the diversity of citizen voices in the Osa Peninsula. 
 
 4. Strengthened capacity of projects selected through a systems criteria by the Osa Territorial Council 
 
 5. Continued grant making and investing in priority projects 
 
 6. Strengthened networks between projects and preexisting funders and capacity strengthening organizations. 
 
 We‚Äôd like to use the Gitcoin funds to support the operational capacity of CEDPO and to pay for attorney fees for the creation of a Costa Rican CEDPO Foundation, so that all of our funds are being managed locally and transparently. We think this will greatly increase CEDPO‚Äôs capacity to receive funding from a broader set of donors, to hire employees, and to develop a locally led organization. We also are being challenged by our current donors to match their funds for 2025, so we would apply the Gitcoin funds to these matching funds.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/18/17

 The **Airdrop Checker** simplifies the process of tracking airdrops across multiple networks. Instead of manually connecting your wallet, zkCodex allows you to input multiple wallet addresses simultaneously. This feature automatically scans and checks for any eligible airdrops based on your wallets' on-chain activity across various supported chains. By entering your addresses, **zkCodex** ensures that you don‚Äôt miss any claimable rewards, giving you a consolidated view of all available airdrops in one place.

 Imagine you own an NFT. While the NFT itself lives on the blockchain, the important things like images, videos, and other data linked to it usually live elsewhere, off-chain. This is where **NFT.Storage** comes in.
 
 NFT.Storage is like a vault for that important data. It‚Äôs a long-term storage public good service that ensures your NFT data (such as images or metadata) is securely stored, backed by the power of decentralized storage on Filecoin and IPFS, which are technologies designed to keep your data safe for the long term.
 
 ## Why Does This Matter?
 
 Without reliable storage, an NFT could lose its value if the image or metadata disappears. Imagine owning a digital art piece that no longer displays the image it‚Äôs supposed to hold‚Äîit could become worthless. NFT.Storage protects against this by using decentralized technologies and smart contracts, ensuring your NFT‚Äôs data remains accessible, even in the future.
 
 ## How Does It Work?
 
 - **Endowment-backed storage**: For a small one-time fee, your NFTs are stored securely for the long term without worrying about ongoing costs. Our on-chain endowment pays the ongoing storage costs.
 - **Trustless Verifiability**: Data stored through NFT.Storage is tagged with a unique digital fingerprint using a CID from IPFS. This allows anyone to verify the data‚Äôs authenticity without needing to trust a specific company.
 - **Redundancy for Security**: Your data isn‚Äôt stored in one place. It‚Äôs spread across servers worldwide through the decentralized Filecoin storage network, ensuring your NFT‚Äôs data is always safe and accessible.
 - **Smart contract management**: The storage process will be managed by smart contracts that automate payments and renew storage provider deals.
 
 ## How We Support Creators and Developers
 
 We make it easy for creators and developers to back up their data by providing seamless integration and robust tools for decentralized storage. Whether you‚Äôre an artist, developer, or platform, we‚Äôre here to help you secure your NFT data for the long haul.
 
 ## Education for the Community
 
 We‚Äôre committed to educating the community on the importance of permanent off-chain data storage for NFTs. NFTs are *not* permanent unless the off-chain data is stored securely and permanently. Additionally, NFTs have the potential to preserve culture, ensuring that important cultural assets remain accessible for future generations.
 
 ## Our Journey Since 2021
 
 Since our launch, NFT.Storage has grown into a trusted platform, storing over 700TB of off-chain data for the NFT community. Although we no longer allow new uploads to the Classic product, all previously uploaded data remains accessible. NFT.Storage Classic was the home of free decentralized storage and bandwidth for NFTs on IPFS and Filecoin. As of June 30, 2024, the Classic upload and pinning products have been decommissioned, but data will continue to be safely stored and accessible via IPFS and the Filecoin Network, with potential latency and availability degradation over time.
 
 Our Classic public good is trusted by over 165,000 users and top companies like Magic Eden, CoinMarketCap, and SolScan.
 
 ## Why We Need Your Support
 
 You can help in two ways:
 
 1. **Vote for us**: Help our community grow and shape the future of NFT storage.
 2. **Donate**: Even a small donation goes a long way to support the maintenance and improvement of NFT.Storage.
 
 Join us in preserving digital art and culture for future generations. Let‚Äôs ensure the NFTs created today remain valuable and accessible forever!",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/608/18

 The engagement metrics are pulled from onchain and offchain data sources.
 
 For instance:
 1 point for 1 transaction on Ethereum.
 5 points for 1 post on Twitter that contains the hashtag or mentions: #ethereum/@ethereum.
 5 points for 1 post on Warpcast that contains the hashtag, mentions, or was posted in a particular channel: #ethereum/@ethereum//ethereum.
 5 points for 1 badge on Talent Protocol.
 
 The application is meant to gamify the data and foster a sense of achievement; rewarding users with a feeling of accomplishment for their activities and participation within a blockchain's ecosystem. Although it is meant to track a user's engagement, it can also amplify their engagement within an ecosystem. The feeling of achievement may make them participate more within their community through creating more onchain transactions, twitter posts, casts, or by using other tooling in their ecosystem. There is currently no onchain incentive as that is not the heart of the application (although something like that may be implemented at some point, provided it maintains the core values of the application. Money or speculative assets are not a core value of the application).
 
 Any EVM blockchain is supported, provided they are properly configured within the app.
 The code is completely open source and built in a way where owners of a blockchain may make a Pull Request to change the layout, color schemes, and data sources for their particular pages. Alongside that, providing developers in the community to opportunity to make improvements, bug fixes, and new ideas to the application.
 
 It aims to push Onchain social protocols forward by implementing ENS, Basename, and other similar protocols. Providing a single profile across the entire blockchain ecosystem.
 
 It upholds the values of transparency by being completely open-sourced with every data source being traced back to its source as possible and decentralization by using the most decentralized tooling possible.
 
 Publics Goods may not be a good match for this application. In that case, we may experiment with a monthly Onchain SaaS model to support operations. Alongside, a possible ERC20 implementation that will reward users of the application for their subscription.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/642/18

 Since colonization, monocultures and the destruction of the forests and indigenous culture shaped the societies of this state. Nowadays the state still has a significant rural population, that has been suffering the effects of rural exodus for almost 100 years. We respect their traditional agriculture and are aligning the syntropic nests and biomass management along with the rice, corn, peanuts and beans production üåæ

 It's way too common in Minas that many of the younger generations don't want to continue the dairy management of the small family farm, but lack the means and connections to establish productive and regenerative uses of the land, and often lease it to cattle ranchers. The Hill local multisig is composed by the Siblings Tatiane e Tarcisio Oliveira and Diogo Jorge as mentor. Together with Augusta, her mother they care very well for us workers. The rest of the family also helps out during high activity moments.

 ## Introduction
 
 Bioregional finance is a financial model that supports sustainable development initiatives tailored to the unique ecological and cultural contexts of a specific region. Northern Uganda, with its diverse ecosystems and community needs, can significantly benefit from such an integrative financial approach. This proposal outlines the basic background, challenges, vision, objectives, key processes, expected opportunities, strategies, outcomes, and next steps for this work in the region.
 
 ## About Northern Uganda
 
 Northern Uganda is typically defined by specific geographic and ecological characteristics, encompassing the following districts:
 
 - Regions: Primarily the Acholi, Lango, West Nile, and parts of the Karamoja region.
  
 - Key Districts: Gulu, Kitgum, Pader, Lira, Apac, Nebbi, and Arua, among others.
  
 
 ## Ecological Features
 
 1. Ecosystems - Savannah and Grasslands: Dominant in many areas, supporting diverse wildlife and pastoral practices, numerous wetlands provide critical habitats for biodiversity and serve as natural water filtration systems, mixed forests and woodland areas are vital for biodiversity and local livelihoods.
  
 2. Climate: Characterized by a tropical savanna climate, with distinct wet and dry seasons, influencing agricultural practices and water availability.
  
 
 ## Cultural and Socioeconomic Aspects
 
 1. Communities: Home to various ethnic groups, including the Acholi, Langi, and Alur, each with unique cultural practices, languages, and traditional knowledge.
  
 2. Economic Activities: Agriculture is the mainstay, with crops like millet, cassava, and maize. Livestock rearing is also significant.
  
 3. Historical Context: The region has experienced conflict, notably during the Lord‚Äôs Resistance Army (LRA) insurgency, impacting social structures and economic development.
  
 
 ## Challenges¬†
 
 Economic Disparities: High levels of poverty and unemployment. Northern Uganda has faced decades of conflicts, particularly due to the Lord‚Äôs Resistance Army (LRA) insurgency, which led to widespread displacement, loss of lives, and destruction of infrastructure. This has had lasting impacts on economic development and social cohesion.
 
 Environmental Degradation: Deforestation, soil erosion, and water scarcity in Northern Uganda presents significant challenges that affect both the ecosystem and the livelihoods of local communities. Here are some key issues:
 
 1. Deforestation: The expansion of agricultural land, logging for timber, and charcoal production have led to extensive deforestation. This reduces biodiversity and contributes to soil erosion.
 
 2. Soil Degradation: Unsustainable agricultural practices, such as monocropping and overgrazing, lead to soil erosion and nutrient depletion.
 
 3. Water Pollution: Poor waste management practices, industrial discharges, and agricultural runoff contribute to water contamination.
 
 4.¬† Climate Change: Northern Uganda is experiencing changing weather patterns, leading to unpredictable rainfall and prolonged dry spells. This exacerbates existing vulnerabilities in agriculture and water availability.
 
 5. Biodiversity Loss: Habitat destruction, overexploitation of resources, and invasive species threaten local flora and fauna.
 
 6.¬† Overexploitation of Natural Resources: Increased population pressure and poverty drive communities to over-harvest resources like fish, wood, and wildlife.
 
 7.¬† Land Degradation: Urbanization, agricultural expansion, and infrastructure development contribute to land degradation.
 
 ## Future Vision
 In the long term, a Northern Uganda bioregional regenerative economy could evolve into a vibrant, self-sustaining system characterized by:
 
 - Resilient Communities: Empowered communities that actively participate in decision-making and resource management, leading to enhanced social cohesion and stability.
  
 - Diverse Economies: An economy that integrates agriculture, renewable energy, tourism, and local crafts, reducing dependency on any single sector.
  
 - Healthy Ecosystems: Restored and thriving ecosystems that provide essential services, support biodiversity, and enhance the quality of life for residents.
  
 - Cultural Revitalization: A renewed appreciation for local traditions and knowledge, integrated into sustainable practices and community initiatives.
  
 
 ## Objectives
 
 In order to realize the vision above, we believe it is important to prioritize these key objectives:
 
 1. Promote Sustainable Development: Encourage investments in green technologies and sustainable agriculture.
  
 2. Enhance Community Participation: Engage local communities in financial decision-making processes.
  
 3. Strengthen Local Economies: Support small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that focus on sustainable practices.
  
 4. Preserve Biodiversity: Fund initiatives aimed at protecting local ecosystems and wildlife.
  
 
 ## Mapping Our Bioregion
 
 Mapping Northern Uganda as a distinct bioregion is essential for understanding its unique ecological, cultural, and economic contexts. This provides a foundation for implementing targeted strategies that promote sustainable development and community resilience, ultimately enhancing the quality of life for its residents while preserving the region's natural heritage.
 
 1. Ecological Cohesion: The bioregion is defined by interconnected ecosystems that share similar climatic and geographical features, influencing local biodiversity and agricultural practices.
  
 2. Cultural Homogeneity: Mapping the bioregion considers the shared cultural practices and historical experiences of the communities, which are vital for community-based development initiatives.
  
 3. Resource Management: Defining the bioregion allows for targeted resource management strategies that address specific environmental and economic challenges, such as deforestation, soil degradation, and water scarcity.
  
 4. Sustainability Focus: A bioregional approach facilitates sustainable practices by considering local ecosystems and community needs, leading to more effective conservation and regeneration efforts.
  
 
 ## Key Collective Mapping Processes
 
 We intend to conduct Collective Mapping Processes in order to get a clearer picture of how Bioregional Finance can benefit our people and local environment. These processes involve collaboration among stakeholders, including local communities, government agencies, NGOs, and researchers. Here are the key components of these mapping processes:
 
 1. Participatory Mapping Workshops: Community Engagement - Workshops are organized to bring together community members to share their knowledge about local resources, land use, and environmental challenges. Mapping Tools: Participants use maps, GIS technology, and other tools to visualize their insights, identifying key ecological zones, resources, and areas of concern.
 
 2. Stakeholder Collaborations: Multi-Stakeholder Platforms - Establishing platforms that include government officials, NGOs, community leaders, and academics facilitates a comprehensive approach to mapping, stakeholders work together to define common objectives related to sustainable development, resource management, and climate resilience.
 
 3. Ecological Assessments: Biodiversity Surveys - Conducting ecological assessments to gather data on local flora and fauna, which helps identify critical habitats and areas needing protection or restoration.
 
 4. Socioeconomic Research: Community Surveys - Collecting quantitative and qualitative data through surveys to understand economic activities, livelihoods, and social dynamics.
 
 5. Geospatial Analysis: GIS Mapping - Utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to overlay ecological, socioeconomic, and cultural data, creating comprehensive maps that inform decision-making.
 
 6. Feedback Loops: Continuous Consultation - Regular feedback sessions with community members and stakeholders ensure that mapping findings are validated and refined over time.
 
 These collective mapping processes will foster a shared understanding of the Northern Uganda bioregion, integrating ecological, cultural, and economic dimensions.¬†
 
 ## Regenerative Opportunities
 
 We can reasonably anticipate identifying the following kinds of opportunities for bioregional finance empowered regeneration in Northern Uganda as they are crucial for leveraging existing strengths and addressing challenges effectively:
 
 1. Renewable Energy Development: with abundant sunlight, there is significant potential for solar energy projects. Community-based solar initiatives can provide electricity, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and empower local businesses and utilizing agricultural waste for biogas can promote waste management, provide energy for cooking, and reduce deforestation.
  
 2. Sustainable Agriculture Practices: transitioning to agroecology can enhance food security, improve soil health, and promote biodiversity. Initiatives like permaculture and organic farming can empower farmers and increase resilience to climate change.
  
 3. Ecotourism and Community-Based Tourism: the region‚Äôs rich biodiversity and cultural heritage offer opportunities for ecotourism. Promoting responsible tourism can generate income while fostering conservation efforts and Involving local communities in tourism initiatives ensures that benefits are equitably distributed and cultural heritage is preserved.
  
 4. Restoration Projects: engaging communities in tree planting initiatives can restore degraded lands, improve biodiversity, and sequester carbon and wetland Restoration, can enhance ecosystem services, such as water filtration and flood control, while supporting local livelihoods.
  
 5.

 In order to create a robust partnership with our local ecosystem and stakeholders, we believe it will be important to pursue a number of strategies designed to channel capital more effectively and empower local capabilities. These include but are not limited to:
 
 1. Establish a Bioregional Finance Fund and Micro-finance: Create a fund to provide microloans and grants for sustainable projects, prioritizing local entrepreneurs.¬†
  
 2. Investment in SMEs: Encourage the establishment of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that utilize local resources sustainably, creating jobs and boosting the local economy.
  
 3. Value Chain Support:¬† Local Market Development - Enhance local supply chains by investing in businesses that process and sell local agricultural products, increasing market access for farmers and reducing reliance on external markets.
  
 4. Capacity Building: Offer training programs for community members on sustainable agricultural practices, eco-friendly technologies, and financial literacy.
  
 5. Public-Private Partnerships: Collaborate with local governments, NGOs, and private sectors to leverage resources and expertise.
  
 6. Monitoring and Evaluation: Develop a robust framework for assessing the impact of ¬† funded projects on the environment and local economies assessments on ecological, economic, and social impacts of regeneration projects in Northern Uganda.
  
 7. Awareness Campaigns: Educate the community about the benefits of sustainable practices and the importance of bioregional finance.
  
 8. Sustainable Economic Practices: Ecotourism Development: Promote ecotourism as a means to generate income while conserving natural resources.
  
 
 ## Expected Outcomes
 
 We expect the end results of these efforts to become visible along many lines and types of impact. These include:
 
 - Economic Growth & job creation: Increased investment in sustainable businesses leading to job creation.
  
 - Environmental Restoration and Sustainability: Improved natural resource management and restoration of ecosystems. Restoration and preservation of local ecosystems through sustainable land use practices, reforestation initiatives, and conservation efforts.¬†

 - Strengthened resilience Against Climate Change: Enhanced capacity of communities to adapt to climate impacts through sustainable practices. Adoption of climate-smart¬†
  
 
 ## Next Steps
 
 Our vision may be large, but our mission is clear. These are the key next steps to progressing this vision here in Northern Uganda:
 
 1. Stakeholder Engagement: Organize meetings with local communities, government officials, and potential investors in Northern Uganda
  
 2. Feasibility Study: Conduct a detailed assessment to identify specific needs and opportunities within the region.
  
 3. Funding Strategy: Develop a plan to secure initial funding for the Bioregional Finance Microfinance Fund.
  
 
 ## Conclusion
 Implementing bioregional finance in Northern Uganda presents a unique opportunity to address socio-economic challenges while promoting environmental sustainability. By fostering local ownership and sustainable practices, This proposal calls for collaboration among stakeholders to realize a sustainable future for Northern Uganda.

We believe it starts with simple regenerative actions that invest in the health and wellness of the individual, the community, and the environment. We‚Äôre experienced in hosting volunteer-based events that allow our community to contribute to environmentally regenerative actions, and this project expands our reach into the waters around Tamarindo. The goal is to facilitate the seeding of a healthy, thriving coral reef, that increases biodiversity in the area and presents educational opportunities for tourists and locals alike, connecting the community with the underwater world.
 
 Coral ecosystem restoration provides the opportunity to effectively halt and reverse degradation, improve ecosystem services, and restore biodiversity. Coral reefs are one of the most diverse and biologically complex ecosystems in the world. This project aims to regenerate natural coral reefs, through the cultivation of corals with techniques that ensure genetic diversity. This is key to increasing the number of founding coral colonies of the ecosystem and the recovery of its structural complexity, which results in greater availability of habitat and food for a great diversity of marine species. 
 
 The project aims to start a coral lab, growing and monitoring corals to seed a new reef in large tanks. The corals will then be planted on metal structures in a nursery and cared for. Data on coral health, biodiversity and biogeochemical factors will be collected and monitored throughout the process. The coral are keystone species, and upon their return, the ecosystems will regenerate, increasing biodiversity of other species to the entire marine area. 
 
 Because of this project's proximity to Tamarindo, a major international tourism destination, it presents a unique opportunity to educate visitors through common tourism experiences like snorkeling and seeing local wildlife. People will be able to tour the coral lab and visit the nursery, raising awareness for the environmental degradation that has occurred through tourism and facilitating their participation in regenerative action and donations. Tourists and volunteers will have the opportunity to participate in the process both onshore and offshore, with knowledgeable guides.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/643/19

 Spanning 2.5 million acres by 2050, Reconnecting Northland supports remote communities in achieving sustainable environmental regeneration, enhancing biodiversity, and promoting economic vitality and social well-being. Northland boasts the highest biodiversity in Aotearoa New Zealand, but the region faces severe species decline, among the highest globally. By empowering communities with the right knowledge, tools, and resources, we enable them to lead the socio-ecological transformation through regenerative local economies. We believe in catalyzing the changes needed for our communities to become resilient and flourish in harmony with the natural environment. 
 
 Founded in 2012 with support from the Tindall Foundation and Foundation North, Reconnecting Northland Trust has evolved from a connectivity conservation model to a community-led initiative tailored to Northland's socio-cultural and socio-economic realities. Over seven years, we‚Äôve refined our practice to champion community-led action, rooted in indigenous principles. We support long-term aspirations by fostering relationships and providing tools, financing, and resources, collaborating with like-minded organizations to create unified, community-tailored plans. Our team of seven staff and six kairaranga (community coordinators) actively supports communities to deliver landscape-scale initiatives, currently working with 14 groups across Northland. 
 
 With over 50% of our team and our CEO being indigenous MƒÅori, and more than 80% of our community interactions being with MƒÅori groups, Reconnecting Northland is deeply rooted in indigenous leadership. We embrace Te Ao MƒÅrama‚Äîa MƒÅori worldview that fosters clarity, connectedness, and harmony with nature‚Äîguiding our work toward ecological regeneration. Achieving Te Ao MƒÅrama requires integrating indigenous knowledge, western science, local expertise, and self-awareness to ensure best practices emerge. 
 
 At the core of our strategy is elevating the MƒÅori worldview as a catalyst for regeneration across Northland. We weave indigenous knowledge into ecological, financial, and human regeneration practices, building a framework that supports community-led socio-ecological action. Reconnecting Northland functions as a Connectivity Catalyst, seed-funding communities to become investment-ready while connecting them to tools and resources that accelerate change and build capability. Our work promotes nature-based enterprises to reduce reliance on grants, fostering regenerative revenue streams. 
 
 After seven years of refining our approach, we are seeking benefactors to help us scale our activities. We‚Äôve helped communities across entire catchments develop 100-year visions and action plans, rapidly building on-the-ground capability. Our communities are ready to effectively deploy the capital required for intergenerational socio-ecological change. 
 
 Our strategy, shaped by lessons from our Tapere (large landscape initiative), addresses barriers like siloed, short-term competitive funding and limited access to support services. Our two core projects‚ÄîConnectivity Partnership (syndicated investment supporting Catchment Action Plans) and Te Kete Hononga (streamlined support for local capability building)‚Äîare designed to overcome these challenges. 
 
 Growing local capability and creating job opportunities to allow people to return to their ancestral lands is essential for community-led regeneration. Over the past seven years, we‚Äôve listened carefully to communities, who have told us what resources, connections, funding, and training they need. In response, we developed and successfully trialed Te Kete Hononga, which weaves together tailored support packages to realize community-led initiatives while building resilience through trusted Kairaranga (community facilitators). 
 
 The profound success of the Te Kete Hononga trial has proven that our community-led model for regeneration works‚Äîand now, we are ready to take the next bold step. To scale our impact across Northland and beyond, we need visionary partners to join us. By securing syndicated investment, we can rapidly expand Te Kete Hononga, accelerating the growth of capability and capacity within communities. This investment will empower local people to lead the socio-ecological transformation, creating resilient ecosystems, strong local economies, and a blueprint for global change. Together, we can catalyze a future where people and nature thrive.

GG22,ENS Ecosystem,Dhive,0xbc7797319B3eD4246c7078CC4e8B28Ea2C6872D0,https://twitter.com/DhiveDotIo,https://github.com/Moona-Lisa,Dhive,https://dhive.io,APPROVED,"## TL;DR
 
 Dhive simplifies access to governance data by providing insights, updates, and monitoring tools across multiple DAOs. Our goal is to become the go-to hub for governance information - similar to how CoinMarketCap consolidates cryptocurrency market data - helping users understand governance activities better, so they can make well-informed decisions in a trusted environment.
 
 ## Why you'll ‚ù§Ô∏è it
 
 - **All-in-One Platform**: Aggregation of governance data from multiple DAOs. 
 - **Trusted Credentials**: Chain-agnostic profiles to enhance trust and credibility. 
 - **Custom Notifications**: Timely notifications about changes on proposals. 
 - **Engaging Visualizations**: Intuitive data analysis through data visualizations.
 
 ## Where we are now
 
 We've successfully developed and launched our MVP for Dhive. This was possible with the support we received from Arbitrum (through Questbook), Mask Network, ENS DAO, Push, and Gitcoin Grants. The community's positive feedback and support have shown that our project is valuable and useful, which motivates us to continue building.
 
 ## Where we are going
 Building on the success of our MVP launch, we plan to expand the platform's capabilities by providing more comprehensive governance data and analytics. Our long term plans include key developments:
 
 - **Data Integration**: expand our data indexing capabilities to include more DAOs and governance related data.
 - **Improve Performance**: enhance overall performance by improving backend systems, implementing caching, and optimizing data retrieval processes.
 - **New Features**: add new features such as vote counters, delegation information, and a calendar for upcoming proposals to keep users informed.
 - **Refine UI/UX**: make the platform more intuitive and user-friendly by introducing filtering and sorting, improving charts, and incorporating user feedback.
 
 ## Why Dhive
 Our platform stands out by indexing on-chain data directly from smart contracts (e.g. ENS Governor) and off-chain data from providers like Snapshot. It employs backend algorithms for data analysis, generating analytics and monitoring tools. Our user interface is intuitive and user-friendly, featuring engaging visualizations that make complex data easy to understand.
 
 The benefit for DAOs such as ENS is twofold. On one hand, providing granular governance data and monitoring tools will help participants, delegates, and other interested parties better understand its governance activities. This leads to more informed and transparent decision-making and potentially results in higher participation in governance activities. On the other hand, the DAO will benefit from increased visibility and engagement from participants involved with other DAOs, as our platform aggregates data across multiple DAOs and attracts a broader audience.

 So far, we have received almost 500,000 uploads from 8,100 people in 100 countries making OLM one of the largest, oldest, and most-open databases on litter, brands & plastic pollution in the world. 
 
 Over 5/8 billion people are connected online but we have only scratched the surface of humanities massive data collection potential. 
 
 During the OLM research in 2015 I was introduced to the concept of tokenisation. 
 
 Proof of work.
 Citizen science.
 Littercoin.
 
 For the last 15+ years I have sacrificed everything to keep OpenLitterMap online but I am running out of money. I only only have 4-6 weeks of runway left before I have to turn it off - please help.
 
 So far,
 Did x2 masters in Geography where I reviewed all academic literature.
 Then taught myself how to code. Coding daily for nearly 10 years.
 Worked at several startups to become a better developer.
 In 2021 I received my first and only funding from Project Catalyst on Cardano to launch littercoin which is designed to be unlike any other token in crypto.
 
 There was and will never be any Littercoin ICO.
 It won't be listed on any exchange.
 There is no trading.
 The only thing you can do with Littercoin is spend it with participating zero waste stores and other merchants in the climate economy.
 It doesn't even have a logo.
 
 Now I need your help to keep OpenLitterMap online, launch new features, and pivot to a new LitterWeek campaign soon to transcend the academic philosophy with a more compelling message that will empower more people to participate.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/608/20

 Dear Fellow Changemakers,
 
 There's a moment when you realize that the path you're walking isn't just a career choice, but a calling. For me, that moment came at the intersection of environmental economics, data science, and the infinite possibilities of web3. I'm Shaan, and I'd like to share with you my journey with Atlantis DAO, a story that began with a simple question: ""How can we bridge the gap between technological innovation and tangible environmental impact?""
 
 ## The Seeds of Change
 
 My journey started in the halls of academia, where environmental economics and business analytics gave me the tools to understand our world's complex challenges. But it was in the vibrant streets of Bengaluru, amidst the bustling energy of local communities, that I found my true purpose. Here, working with Atlantis DAO, I discovered that the future of environmental conservation isn't just in the numbers and data ‚Äì it's in the hearts and hands of communities coming together.
 
 As a partner and innovation lead at Atlantis DAO, I've had the privilege of witnessing the transformation of abstract concepts into living, breathing initiatives. Our Sacred Sanctuaries, beginning with our pioneering project in Bangalore, aren't just physical spaces ‚Äì they're testaments to what's possible when we blend traditional wisdom with technological innovation.
 
 ## The Bridge Builder
 
 My role at Atlantis has always been about building bridges. Between the precision of data analytics and the organic nature of community building. Between the revolutionary potential of web3 and the pressing needs of local environmental initiatives. Having worked with B corporations like Ben & Jerry's, I brought with me a deep understanding of how to measure and value socio-economic impact. But Atlantis has taught me that true impact goes beyond metrics ‚Äì it's about creating ripples of positive change that transform communities.
 
 ## Our Technological Canvas
 
 In my daily work, I find myself weaving together multiple threads: analyzing on-chain and off-chain data to guide our decisions, applying Bayesian econometrics to understand environmental justice gaps, and designing governance mechanisms that align capital with community needs. It's like conducting an orchestra where every instrument ‚Äì from SQL databases to community feedback ‚Äì plays a crucial role in our symphony of change.
 
 ## The Sacred Vision
 
 Our Sacred Sanctuaries hold a special place in my heart. They're not just projects; they're living laboratories where we're proving that a solarpunk future isn't just a dream ‚Äì it's an achievable reality. Through these spaces, we're demonstrating how web3 can transcend its digital origins to create tangible environmental and social impact.
 
 ## Looking Forward
 
 As I look ahead, I see Atlantis DAO as more than an organization ‚Äì it's a movement. We're building a future where technology serves as a catalyst for environmental preservation, where community decisions are powered by data but guided by heart, and where every individual has the tools to become a steward of our planet.
 
 Our protocol and app are designed to be the infrastructure of this vision. They're not just platforms for transactions; they're gateways to meaningful participation in environmental conservation. Whether it's through our bounty system that rewards positive impact, our community governance mechanisms, or our data-driven approach to measuring success, every element is crafted to empower and engage.
 
 ## The Personal Touch
 
 When I'm not immersed in data or community building, you might find me mountain biking through trails, practicing yoga, or planning my next summit challenge. These personal pursuits remind me that our work at Atlantis is about preserving and enhancing the natural world we all share and love.
 
 ## An Invitation
 
 To everyone reading this ‚Äì whether you're a data scientist, an environmental enthusiast, or someone who simply cares about our planet's future ‚Äì Atlantis DAO is more than just a protocol or an app. It's a community of dreamers and doers, united in our belief that technology can be a force for environmental good.
 
 We're not just building tools; we're nurturing a movement where every action, no matter how small, contributes to a larger tapestry of positive change. Through our bounties, governance systems, and Sacred Sanctuaries, we're creating spaces where technology meets purpose, where data meets heart, and where individual actions culminate in collective impact.
 
 Join us in this journey. Whether you're contributing code, completing bounties, or simply spreading the word, there's a place for you in our vision of a sustainable, technologically-empowered future.
 
 With hope and determination,
 
 Shaan Patel
 Partner & Innovation Lead, Atlantis DAO

 As a hobby, I help run projects like Anu Initiative, IEF, and consult for initiatives such as Carbon Counting Club, Family Food Bank, Aluxes, USEE.Global and Let‚Äôs Grow DAO (LGD) - all using tech and nature to create tangible, sustainable impact.
 
 üîç Key Contributions:
 
 Regenerative R&D:
 
 1. Co-founded the Impact Evaluation Foundation (IEF), building an open-source platform to measure, verify, and report ecological impacts using blockchain and AI.
 2. Developed the Anu Initiative, which connects contributions with tangible ecological outcomes using non-tradeable NFTs, solving transparency issues in environmental fundraising.
 3. Consulted for the Carbon Counting Club (CCC), gamifying carbon sequestration through Carbon Counting Coins for every pound of CO2 sequestered.
 4. Provided consultation for the Family Food Bank, which uses sustainable technologies to enhance food security through the innovative PyraPOD model.
 5. Member of Let‚Äôs Grow DAO (LGD), focused on uniting and growing the ReFi movement by supporting on-chain ecological impact verifier programs and building a reputation model based on the Ecological Benefits Framework (EBF).
 
 Education and Growth:
 
 1. Spearheaded a training program for Impact Evaluators at IEF, helping individuals become certified experts in ecological data verification.
 2. Conducted research at Robert Kennedy College and University of Cumbria, highlighting how blockchain can elevate transparency and trust in impact-driven spaces.
 3. Regularly share insights on how Web3 tech can be used to boost real-time tracking and verifiable impact for ecological projects.
 
 Operational Support:
 
 1. As the Founder and CTO of Anu Initiative, I designed a system that links financial contributions with real-world ecological outcomes, improving trust and transparency for contributors.
 2. Conceptualised and helped structure the operations of Impact Evaluation Foundation, ensuring scalability and reliable access to impact data across multiple sectors.
 3. Consulted for Family Food Bank to implement the PyraPOD model, which boosts food security by integrating sustainable technologies into local communities.
 
 üìö Academic Contributions:
 
 1. Conducted research on blockchain‚Äôs role in impact-driven sectors, surveying 281 organizations globally.
 2. Demonstrated how blockchain can enhance transparency and trust in ecological projects, while addressing the challenges of fees and usability.
 3. Showcased the potential for blockchain adoption to double in coming years as more organizations embrace its real-time tracking capabilities.
 
 üå± Long-Term Goal for Impact Projects
 My long-term vision is to use blockchain to connect every act of impact with real, measurable results. By tracking both contributions and outcomes, we‚Äôll maximise impact, reduce inefficiencies, and make sure every action for the planet counts.
 
 üöÄ Why My Work Matters
 I believe the future of impact projects lies in transparent, non-speculative tech-driven solutions that empower communities to grow their impact with confidence. Every good deed for nature should be tracked and amplified to create lasting change.
 
 üåç Let‚Äôs Regenerate Together!
 Ready to get in on the action? Whether you‚Äôre a developer, a nature lover, or someone looking to make a difference, you can help grow the regenerative movement. Let‚Äôs build a greener, better future - one impact at a time!

In a polarized, isolating world, inside a 400 year-old chateau which lay empty for a decade, we created a sustainable and regenerative ecosystem that builds bridges: between local and global ideas, rural and cosmopolitan populations, between countless disciplines, and between the world of yesterday and that of tomorrow.
 
 For the past 8 years we have been developing a virtuous ecosystem made of 5 complementary structures:
 
 FE≈∏TOPIA, a community of ~200 international artists, technologists, entrepreneurs, and researchers rethinking the world of tomorrow, which every year turns the Chateau into a co-living /co-working space in the winter (Dec-April).
 
 SAS. CH√ÇTEAU DU FE≈∏, a profitable company that rents Fe√ø in the summer (Mai-Nov) for events with aligned values. 
 
 FE≈∏ ARTS, non-profit in charge of our yearly multi-disciplinary arts festival that brings 1500 people for a unique weekend-long immersive experience, as well as artist residencies prior to the festival.
 
 FRIENDS OF FE≈∏, non-profit in charge of bridging between natural heritage and built heritage. It leads projects and workshops around permaculture/agroforestry, biodiversity preservation and old techniques of renovation.
 
 CONVERGENCE DES POSSIBLES, a consortium with local nonprofits in charge of nurturing our local community to support projects around food, energy and technological resiliency. 
 
 We have prototyped a sustainable model, which is improving its land, its local economy, its community fabric, its people, its culture, its heritage and that has already catalyzed others to do the same. 
 The last grant was awarded to Friends of Fe√ø, and we are applying again through this non-profit. For the past seven years, Friends of Fe√ø has been stewarding 100 acres of forest and a 2 acres permaculture garden. The organization has hosted 20 week-long workshops focused on sustainability and empowerment for the local community, particularly for children from underprivileged neighborhoods.
 
 We have also transformed the garden management by planting meadows and indigenous plants, eliminating the need for mowing. Our garden has since inspired other historical monuments to adopt a similar approach.
 Recently, we've been working on a tree nursery project in collaboration with a national non-profit called PLANTEURS. By next September, the nursery should be fully operational, with a production capacity of 10,000 to 30,000 trees per year. We are applying for this grant because we need to renovate a space near the nursery, which we call the REGEN HOUSE. This space will provide housing for the nursery workers, serve as a permanent office space for PLANTEURS, and include two guest bedrooms for people working on regenerative projects. Currently, we have a shortage of spaces to accommodate our partners.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/643/23

 Okay, firstly let me share some of the books which get me into this path, and could nurture our audience:
 
 **The Ecology of Commerce, A Declaration of Sustainability by Paul Hawking 1993**
 Here he mentions the Regenerative Economy concept, I read it around 2011.

 Let me introduce myself and tell your a brief resume of my story:
 
 I started cleaning the Beach when I moved to Tulum, Mexico in 2005. It was hear breakening and alarming the amount of plastic from around the World circulating in the Atlantic coastline of Mexico. Since then, I focus in the Plastic problem. Everytime with larger initiatives.
 
 Around 2010 I joined Global Ceramic Creations Technology, a Swidish 100% biodegradable cement, of edible degree. Stronger, lighter and flexible. The mission was to substitute the ""Portland Cement"" which is one of the top 10 most polluting industries.
 I joined as VP of BD back in the day, with the mission to promote *The Mayan Pyramid* project on top of the water which produce Hydroelectric energy and Nuclear Energy underneath the hotel. Because of the 2009 crisis, and the logistic costs it was unfeasable to run the factory or the project. Since then I keep a close eye in the Climate Technologies. At the same time I was already pluging and investigating Proof of Work back in the day.

 It was created in 2016, by Web3 Labs founder and is maintained by the Web3 Labs team, who donated it to the Hyperledger Foundation at the start of 2024 to further build awareness of the project and widen the potential contributor base beyond just the Web3 Labs team.
 
 As a JVM library designed for interacting with Ethereum L1 clients, Web3j has recently achieved a significant milestone by becoming the first web3 library to support EIP-4844. This addition enables the capability to send blob transactions, benefiting both L1 and L2 users by substantially reducing storage costs on the L1 layer. 
 
 Building on this momentum, we aim to enhance Web3j's capabilities to interact seamlessly with L2 client nodes, such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon-zkEVM, starting with Arbitrum and gradually extending support to other networks.

 We present an innovative rollup architecture that efficiently utilizes FRI and SNARKs to prove data availability and storage in the network. Our solution enables blockchain scaling to handle data volumes up to petabytes (PiB) and potentially exabytes (EiB), supporting resource-intensive applications and enhancing decentralization.
 
 ## üîÄüñ¥üî¢Decentralized RAID Array
 
 Using RS encoding, our network functions as a vast decentralized RAID array. Each node stores its disk and receives data consistency proofs via SNARKs. For high reliability with 50% node failure, only eight-fold redundant storage is required. This means that to store 1 GiB of data, the network needs only 8 GiB, whereas traditional systems require hundreds of replicas for comparable reliability.
 
 ## üöÄüñ•Ô∏èHigh Performance with Mersenne31
 
 By using FRI and compact 31-bit Mersenne31 prime fields (proposed in 2024), we achieve high processing speeds: even a standard MacBook Air can process up to 1 Gbit of data per second, including creating FRI commitments.
 
 ## ‚ôæÔ∏èüåÄInfinite Scaling through Recursion
 
 The minimal stored data structure is an FRI commitment. This allows the rollup to store its own blocks within itself, opening possibilities for recursive rollup deployment and unlimited network scaling.
 
 ## üéØAdvantages of our solution:
 
 * üìàBlockchain scaling to work with data volumes up to PiB, potentially to EiB
 * üåêSupport for data-rich Web3 applications (social networks, games, etc.)
 * üõ°Enhancing decentralization and censorship resistance for DApps and DeFi

 It gives your config validations, full type-safety with built-in docs, and the ability to reuse items and compose them using functions, rather than simply toggling between environments and simple string templates.
 
 A plugin system allows sensitive config data to be pulled from a variety of backends. Currently encrypted files and 1Password plugins exist, with more on the way.
 
 Drop-in integrations allow DMNO to be integrated into code very quickly, without any custom glue code. Currently integrations exist for Next.js, Remix, Astro, Vite, and Node.js, with several more in development. While DMNO is TypeScript based, it can be used with any tech stack, as config values can be injected into commands.
 
 Additional security features help keep sensitive data safe - including automatic leak detection, log redaction, and http request scanning.
 
 We are currently exploring ways to use web3 and distributed cryptography to give teams a novel secure secrets backend without complex setup and maintenance, in a way that abstracts away the web3 details and can be used by anyone, regardless of web3 experience. See our [award winning project from ETH San Francisco 2024](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/dmno-pkp-secrets-vaytr).
 
 While this tool is built for ALL developers, it is extremely well suited to the web3 space, given the additional security requirements and desire for full data ownership.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/611/25

 Web3Domains.com is a dedicated independent content platform, focused on providing timely news and educational guides about the ever-evolving Web3 landscape. But with your help we can be so much more!
 
 Our primary goal is to address the challenges of ""findability"" for Web3 content, by people looking for facts and information via Google Organic Search, SEO and SEM. We want the important news and stories, (which are happening in the obscure parts of Web3), to be found by people searching via Web2.
 
 We seek grant funding from the Gitcoin Grants program to empower our independent content creation efforts, to empower thought leaders as authors, while driving awareness and adoption of Web3 technologies, product/ service benefits, and success stories.
 
 ## Objective
 
 Our objective is to establish Web3Domains.com as the go-to resource for information on decentralized domains and Web3 identity.
 
 We aim to simplify the discovery process for users, and working with Web3 thought leaders to create high-quality content, for SEO optimization, and engage the Web3 community through traditional Web2 SEM, such as social media discussions and interactive events.
 
 By amplifying our efforts, we aspire to foster a thriving ecosystem of informed and empowered Web3 users and authors.
 
 ## The Problem & Our Solution
 
 The lack of easily discoverable and quality content about Web3 poses a significant barrier for new users entering the Web3 space.
 
 As more individuals and organizations seek to explore Web3 identity and decentralized domains, it is essential to provide them with accurate and helpful content, including the stories and background on Web3 success.
 
 Web3Domains.com addresses this challenge by working with Web3 thought leaders and paying them for producing and publishing informative content for Web3 users, while optimizing for search engines like Google and DuckDuckGo.
 
 Our solution centers around driving awareness, increasing desired-searchable information communities and audiences are looking for, while creating a hub for community discussion and education for users and new thought leaders.
 
 ## Accomplishments & Strategic Assets
 
 Web3Domains.com's soft launch has been met with success, as we have connected with numerous independent Web3 content creators and published a couple dozen articles from ten different writers and reporters.
 
 This effort has contributed to the growth of the Web3 industry, by providing very valuable content and context on key subjects.
 
 Our premium domain name asset, Web3Domains.com, serves as a strategic advantage, as it contains the ""exact match SEO keyword"" to help users find key content via Google Search, (as naming, domains, and identity is part of every Web3 project and organization).
 
 ## Grant Proposal
 
 With the support of Gitcoin Grants program, Web3Domains.com intends to:
 
 1. **Empower Independent Content Creation**: Allocate funding to pay independent content writers and human resources to produce high-quality articles, news, and guides about the intersection between the Metaverse, NFTs, and decentralized domains and web3 identity.
 
 2. **Enhance SEO, SEM and Visibility**: Optimize content for search engines to improve visibility and reach for Web3-related topics (to get found in Web2); ensuring that new and existing users can easily find relevant, reliable, and informative content.
 
 3. **Engage the Community**: Host social-audio discussions via Twitter spaces, Podcasts, and other speaking opportunities, to engage the Web2/Web3 community, facilitate knowledge-sharing, and raise awareness for decentralized identity and Web3 technologies.
 
 4. **Build Partnerships**: Collaborate with Web2/Web3 industry leaders, organizations, and content creators to expand our network and strengthen the impact of our educational and informational efforts.

 In the mid-20th century, Jonive Creek was dredged to mitigate flooding, which caused significant damage to the surrounding ecosystems. We are now working to repair and restore the landscape.
 
 We are restoring the floodplain, placing the land into a trust, and converting the housing on the upper land into a nonprofit, limited equity housing cooperative.
 
 All funds raised through this Gitcoin project will be used to support work and equipment to reshape the hillside, maximizing water retention and aquifer recharge. Our plan includes the creation of multiple basins and ponds, connected by contoured terraces to manage water flow.
 
 Max Kee discusses the work already done with the funds from Ma Earth Grants Round 1:
 
 [Interview with Max Kee](https://youtu.be/zBWRtjR85uA)
 
 We observe the water as it flows down the hill into the creek. Through carefully planned swales, basins, and ponds, we slow and spread the water throughout the landscape. We prepare and apply our own compost, intentionally rotate crops, use cover cropping, select seeds for drought tolerance, bury large amounts of biomass in hugelkultur mounds, and practice rotational grazing. This leads to increased soil fertility and reduced groundwater demands. We avoid tilling beds after they‚Äôve been opened for the first time. Additionally, we incorporate perennial trees and shrubs, nitrogen fixers, and pollinator plants into each of the garden landscapes.
 
 HeartSeed Farm is closely connected to the BeeHive School, nestled within the farm itself. Here, students engage in farm work by weeding and planting, gaining hands-on experience in recognizing and valuing a thriving ecosystem, and understanding how a farm can work in harmony with its surroundings.
 
 The bulk of the work involves shaping the hillside to maximize water retention and aquifer recharge. We envision four basins and two ponds added to the hillside, with contoured terraces conveying water between them. We‚Äôve already created a pond at the top of the hill, and the first basin will be situated near its outlet to receive overflow. This basin will have two outlets connecting to other basins on either side of the slope, positioned as high as the contour line allows. The second basin will capture runoff from the neighboring pasture, as well as from the first basin.
 
 Our existing basins capture 10,000 gallons of water annually. With your funding, we aim to increase this capacity by an additional 30,000 gallons each year.
 
 The basins will feed ponds in the valley. Native wetland plants will be used to mitigate erosion around the ponds and basins. The terraced areas that convey water between the basins will be used for annual and perennial food crops, interspersed with pasture blocks for winter grazing.
 
 This project will enhance habitat for native species, reduce soil and creek bed erosion, and provide essential water for crops during the dry season. By sinking more water into the earth, we reduce the need to draw from groundwater wells.

 **My name is Mike Spaulding, or ""The Hill"" as many of you may know me. For the last 4 years I have dedicated my life to building a larger and more productive network to make direct impacts for our oceans, foster blockchain onboarding, build implementable use cases, and have fun with the global communities I am part of. This effort has led me to be a Gitcoin citizen, part of Let‚Äôs Grow Dao, and a founder of three successful projects that are still in operation today.**
 
 **Let‚Äôs break down this impact:**
 
  **Regenerative R&D:** *Contributions to the development and innovation of regenerative finance, technology, and systems.*
 
 -Contributed to the development of C.H.A.R.M AI coral farming robot, this makes coral growing simple and tracks all conditions, growth rates, and carbon sequestration as each coral is grown. I funded part of this research and development personally while leading the marketing and onboarding to the Cycloturtles NFT project that was used to directly fund the later stages of this specific R&D. Currently the system works and is being used on Magnetic Island in Queensland Australia https://x.com/CycloTurtles/status/1706152280851145112
 -Through the Cycloturtles project, our holders had the opportunity to steward corals. This provided all holders with the opportunity to directly interact with their coral daily by feeding and grooming them to stay in optimal health. https://x.com/dieseltechdad/status/1785088471196930168 
 -My current focus is building a Dapp (decentralized application) to provide aggregated research data, methodologies, and public access to direct coral reef regeneration all over the world as a public good. https://x.com/Coral__Connect
 https://www.coralconnect.life/
 
 
  **Education and Growth:** *Efforts to educate and nurture the growth of individuals and communities within the regenerative space.*
 
 -Provide daily motivational GM‚Äôs
 -Have written two books about personal responsibility regarding the human condition and our responsibility to those around us as well as the environments in which we live. These are currently undergoing publishing with Kingfisher Media.
 -Participated in Let‚Äôs grow live 24/7 spaces for multiple two week stretches to onboard new people to REFI and educate others of sustainable projects and practices.
 -Expanded the Arbitrum ecosystem personally by giving away 5,000+ in $ARB to over 550 holders in our original NFT community and provided two direct use cases for them to promptly learn the ecosystem. 
 ArbScan Transaction #‚Äôs 0xa145db6d9cbc1144b90f9643c6b065a81f2b372edc7ff27ed7cd05df9871ce3a

 -Participated in weekly X spaces for over 3 years fostering an inclusive and informational space for refi, environmental impact, financial responsibility, innovative technology showcasing, encouraging use cases for specific chains and much more.
 -Coral education for thousands of Australian children and university students was provided through the developmental partnership with Beyond coral. This helps ensure that awareness is met with amazement to create a lasting memory of sustainable regeneration on a personal level.
 
 All of this can be seen in my personal Profile page on X https://x.com/hardmoustache 
 
 
 **Operational Support:** *Key roles played in supporting the operational needs of regenerative organizations or initiatives.*
 
 -Serve as part of the marketing team for Let‚Äôs Grow DAO
 -Serve as a voting member of Let's Grow DAO
 -Served as Co-host, Host, and Steward for ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Grow Live‚Äù broadcasts for the last year, All spaces are recorded and available on X https://x.com/LetsGROWdao
 
 -Serve as CMO for Notessential, a company built specifically to teach others of their individual value, and what a difference we can make collectively when we put all of our skills together for direct impact. I moved from my home country to serve this purpose and build a larger movement. This meant attending many Web3/Blockchain events around the world and having hundreds of heart-to-heart talks with individuals to build an outstandingly reputable P2P network. This broader network was also funneled into direct impacts. https://x.com/NotEssential_io
 -Serve as Founder and CMO of Coral Connect and personally onboard coral nurseries around the world.
 -Provide free grant writing consultation for Gitcoin, several blockchains, and larger scale government grants.
 
 
 **Impact on Local Communities and Bioregions:** *Tangible contributions to local communities or bioregions, driving ecological, social, and economic regeneration.*
 -Visit local preschools to read them stories about sustainability and friendship while encouraging their individual creativity. https://x.com/CycloTurtles/status/1602470972619165696
 -Organized and participated in many beach and public park clean ups. U.S., Australia, Indonesia, and will be organizing in Palau. This creates direct and immediate change in every single place the impact was made. Fostering a larger scale personal responsibility and better connective relationship with the environments we all share. https://x.com/NotEssential_io
 **Wrap up**
 All of these efforts collectively expand the larger REFI network, methodology, public perception, and positive adoption. As I prepare to move countries a second time I will expand our network to Palau, in conjunction with yet another direct impact. My unique position allows me to continue to grow the entire network through direct action. My involvement with Let's Grow DAO, my time, and my skills have all been applied in prior Gitcoin rounds, spaces, and live broadcasts helping to push the network forward. My largest focus is creating an inclusive, entertaining environment for everyone to share, learn, and grow together. 
 It is my firm understanding that each and every individual has the capacity to change this world. However, when we take action as communities and larger networks, we show the world that in REFI **Together WE are all ESSENTIAL.**",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/16/25

 Our Organisation is creating a ""Learning Environment"" - a built and biological environment that is intentionally designed to enhance and enable Learning (from visitors and volunteers to multi-day courses). 
 
 The health of the ""Learning Environment"" is dependent on the health of the Organisation, is dependent on the health of Place and Community, and vice versa.
 
 Within the Learning Environment we facilitate multidisciplinary learning experiences that engage the whole person, empower learners, and offer opportunities to develop skills to navigate our changing times including preventative mental health, working together, bioregional and regenerative land care and growing food. 
 
 Our learning experiences enable learners of all ages to return to their communities to work on the ground and bring about locally-specific Equity, Resilience & Wellbeing.

 * Rangatahi (youth) 
 * Community Education 
 * Global programmes - Here is a [blog](https://www.learningenvironment.nz/post/discovering-the-learning-environment/) from our Earlham College intern.
 
 Our target group is our future leaders, especially rangatahi (young people) 16-24 years. We need to support our youth right now. In NZ, the number of young people diagnosed with mood or anxiety disorders has more than doubled in 10years; from 9.9% in 2012, to 24.6% in 2022 - *Ministry of Health, NZ*.

 **Regrowing our Relationship to Food**
 Creating opportunities for our community and visitors to remember the relationship we have with our foodscapes. 
 
 The food from the veggie gardens and orchards is distributed out to our community via self-harvest, courses and through local food service providers (eg food banks, and public community pantries). Last year we donated 5,500kg of fruit and vegetables and gifted 400 seedlings. 
 
 In April 2024 we hosted a Harvest and Wellbeing Celebration. The intention was to acknowledge the season, share food with the community and receive wellbeing offerings eg massage, workshops, and games. 
 
 > ""A great day and such a beautiful kaupapa to bring people together and build community connection and resilience. More of this is needed. Learning Environment has been so valuable to this community and you provide the energy and vibrancy which is needed. So looking forward to more ways we can work together that is joyful and intentional. Mauri ora ki a kaautau."" - *Te Ao Hou Marae about the Harvest Celebration.*

 ## Latest updates
 
 We‚Äôve been hard at work improving EVMcrispr, and we‚Äôre excited to share some powerful new features that enhance your experience and streamline your interactions:
 
 - **ENS Domain Support:** You can now use ENS domains directly within the code. Simply type `@ens(vitalik.eth)` to resolve and use the associated address instantly. This makes your scripts cleaner and more intuitive, saving time and reducing the need to copy and paste long addresses.
 - **Connect to Safe:** We‚Äôve also added support for connecting to a Safe. By entering your Safe address (e.g., `gno:0x...`), you‚Äôll be redirected to that specific Safe with the EVMcrispr app open, and your previously loaded script will be ready to go. This smoothens the workflow, making it quicker to manage and execute actions within your Safe. It is a powerful alternative to the Transaction Builder.

 Facet is an Ethereum rollup that addresses specific shortcomings associated with existing Layer 2 (L2) rollup technologies. It is the first ""public good"" rollup that fully retains the security and decentralization principles of Ethereum Layer 1, making it the most secure, trustless rollup on Ethereum.
 
 ### Understanding Rollups
 
 Ethereum rollups are blockchains whose state is derived from Ethereum's history. Rollups batch transactions off-chain, then submit a smaller transaction to Ethereum, reducing congestion and enabling lower transaction fees. While this approach saves on costs, most rollups rely on **centralized sequencers**, and all L2s have **privileged keys** and **upgradeable contracts**, introducing risks of censorship and centralization.
 
 ### Facet's Unique Approach
 
 Facet tackles these key issues directly:
 
 - **Decentralized (""Based"") Sequencing**: Facet utilizes Ethereum's own validators for sequencing, eliminating reliance on a centralized sequencer. This ensures full Ethereum-level security and decentralization.
 - **No Privileged Keys**: Facet removes the need for multi-sigs or governance councils by introducing a novel gas mechanism, ensuring there are no privileged actors capable of upgrading or altering the protocol.
 
 This makes Facet the first-ever **based sovereign rollup** on Ethereum! But we prefer to call it a Layer 1+.
 
 ---
 
 # The Layer 1+ Advantage
 
 Facet introduces the concept of **Layer 1+ (L1+)**, a hybrid model combining the strengths of Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions. Unlike typical L2s, Facet preserves all of Ethereum's core functionality while scaling efficiently:
 
 - **100% Uptime**: Facet remains fully operational and accessible as long as Ethereum is live, with no additional points of failure or potential downtime.
 - **Censorship Resistance**: No single entity or group can censor Facet transactions, maintaining open and unrestricted access for all participants.
 - **Credible Neutrality**: All Facet transactions are processed with absolute fairness, without bias or favoritism.
 - **No Privileged Keys**: Facet cannot be altered or upgraded by privileged actors. Upgrades can only be made through decentralized consensus (hard fork), mirroring Ethereum‚Äôs own governance model.
 
 Facet offers a solution that **scales Ethereum without compromise**.
 
 ---
 
 # Update Since the Last Round
 
 Since our last Gitcoin round, we‚Äôve made significant strides in the development of Facet Protocol:
 
 1. **Arbitrary Contract Deployment**: Facet now allows for the permissionless deployment of arbitrary contracts. This required the development of a decentralized approach to a native gas token for spam prevention and more.
 2. **EVM-Compatible Blockchain**: Facet is now fully EVM-compatible. We have re-written the codebase, forking components of OP‚Äôs architecture (geth, bridges, etc.), establishing Facet as an EVM-equivalent blockchain. This allows for effortless migration of existing smart contracts and requires no learning curve for developers already familiar with Ethereum.
 3. **Private Security Audit**: The protocol is currently undergoing a full private audit by Zellic.io, a best-in-class firm specialized in securing emerging technologies and protocols. Zellic‚Äôs expertise in both EVM and L1/L2 Rollups ensures that Facet v2 will be robust and secure.
 
 ---
 
 # Plans for Funding
 
 As Facet is a public good rollup, the Facet team holds no privileged position within the protocol, making grant funding crucial for accelerating the development and maturation of the ecosystem.
 
 Any funding received through this Gitcoin round will be used to accelerate the development of the Developer Ecosystem for Facet Protocol. Specifically, we aim to:
 
 - Build out developer onboarding materials, making it easier for new developers to understand and begin working on Facet quickly.
 - Improve and expand developer tools, including APIs, SDKs, and data models that streamline integration and deployment.
 - Foster an environment that encourages experimentation and innovation on Facet, with grants and support for early developers building the ecosystem.
 
 As a public good rollup, our priority is creating an accessible, decentralized platform that empowers the next wave of Web3 builders.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/610/27

 cherry.builders addresses a painpoint that is common to many builders and hackers: ""how do I casually find other builders with complementary skillsets?"". The key word here is ""casually"", since the go-to option Fiverr is very formal. Therefore, cherry.builders can be thought of as P2P Fiverr, or Tinder for Builders.
 
 ____Phases to Date____
 1) The project started at ETHWarsaw (6-8th Sep 2024), where we won the main hackathon prize, plus 5 sponsor bounties: Request Network, Celo, Worldcoin, Ora and DB Forest.
 2) We had a lot of interest in cherry.builders as a tool for team formation ahead of hackathons, so we conducted feedback sessions with the founders / organisers of ETHRome, ETHWarsaw and ETHDublin and soon also ETHDam and ETHBucharest. 
 3) When we saw the raw energy and density of builders at Edge City Lanna and other pop-up cities in Chiang Mai, we decided start shipping, gathering feedback and iterating fast.
 
 ____Lessons Learnt from Hackathon Organisers____
 üçí use privy for social login, airstack to prepopulate profiles, mbd to prioritise matching, zkPass for sybil resistance
 üçí useful to incentivise hackers to sign-up early
 üçí filter ""I have a project"" vs ""I'm looking for a project""
 üçí work on algorithm
 üçí ways to verify participants - OTP, event password...
 üçí sponsors often request participant data from hackathon for hiring research
 
 ____Edge City Lanna Experimentation____
 Being in Chiang Mai, Thailand, at Edge City Lanna, has allowed us to dive into a fast iterative cycle. For the past week we have been shipping fast, demoing on stage, getting feedback from builders and feeding that back into development. As you can see in our public github repo, we have:
 üçí added privy social login, so users can login with wallet, farcaster, email, google or github.
 üçí secured and future-proofed the site and db, ready to scale both in users (secure) and in code (separation of concerns).
 üçí improved and iterated on ui/ux, based on feedback collected on the ground.
 üçí built an integration with cursive.team , who built the tech in the wristbands of everyone at Edge City Lanna. Now cherry users can verify their attendance at Lanna by tapping their own NFC wristband. Furthermore, in view of the upcoming Lanna hackathon, they can check a filter to only see other Lanna participants.
 
 ____Loose Roadmap____
 Our full focus is on product. We will keep iterating to get a product that people really love to use, with our target audience being web3 builders, specifically at pop-up cities and hackathons. We have a loose roadmap that is not fixed:
 1) Edge City Lanna (10th Oct - 10th Nov)
 2) Lanna Hackathon (2nd - 8th Nov)
 3) Official Launch
 4) ETHGlobal Bangkok (15th - 17th Nov)
 5) Gather all feedback and back to deep work on product
 6) Bring cherry.builders to web3 hackathons and pop-up cities (2025)",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/611/27

Lenders can verify creditworthiness without accessing sensitive personal information, ensuring privacy and data security.
 
 6. **Health and Medical Records Management**: NebulaID can securely manage digital health records, enabling healthcare providers to access verified medical histories while ensuring patient confidentiality. This is vital in scenarios like medical emergencies, where quick access to accurate data can save lives. Exploring things around FHE for that purpose. 
 
 7. **Asset Management and Ownership Verification**: NebulaID facilitates secure and verifiable proof of ownership for assets such as real estate, vehicles, and digital assets. This reduces fraud and disputes in transactions involving property and other high-value items.
 
 8. **Enhanced Security and Resilience**: The integration of blockchain technology with satellite networks creates a system resistant to single points of failure, offering a highly secure and reliable digital ID solution.
 
 NebulaID directly addresses the need for a robust digital ID infrastructure by deploying a network of satellites that serve as secure nodes in a blockchain system. This architecture mitigates risks such as data breaches, cyberattacks, and identity theft, which are inherent to earthbound networks.
 
 ## System Architecture and Components
 
 1. **Blockchain Integration**: Built on Ethereum, NebulaID employs smart contracts written in Solidity to automate digital identity management, including creation, updating, access control, and revocation. The use of Ethereum ensures a permissionless environment, enhancing transparency and security.
 
 2. **Satellite Network Design**: The NebulaID satellite constellation functions as a decentralized network, where each satellite acts as a node in the blockchain system. This setup provides a resilient infrastructure for secure digital ID storage, synchronization, and verification.
 
 3. **Decentralized Storage and Transmission**: Utilizing decentralized storage solutions like IPFS, NebulaID ensures that digital IDs are stored securely and redundantly, avoiding reliance on centralized servers. Advanced encryption methods (e.g., SHA-256 and AES) are used to protect data during transmission, maintaining high levels of security.
 
 4. **Error Handling and Data Integrity**: To combat the challenges of space, such as radiation and latency, NebulaID incorporates radiation-hardened components and advanced error-correcting codes. These measures ensure data integrity and reliability, even in the harsh conditions of space.
 
 ## Future Prospects and Vision
 
 As humanity's ventures into space expand, the need for secure, scalable digital identification systems becomes increasingly critical. NebulaID positions itself as a pioneer in the convergence of blockchain technology, decentralized identity management, and satellite networks. By harnessing these innovations, NebulaID aspires to redefine the digital identity landscape for a multi-planetary future, ensuring security, privacy, and autonomy for every individual and entity involved. This project holds the potential to transform not only digital identity management on Earth but also in the emerging arena of space exploration and interplanetary transactions, contributing to the greater good of the planet and human civilization.

 > The world‚Äôs two billion smallholders produce 35% of the world‚Äôs food and up to 70% in low and middle income countries. They produce the majority of key agricultural commodities like rubber, coffee and cacao but often get the skinny end of the wedge of the value they produce and have little bargaining power to change their circumstances. 
 > 
 > Furthermore, despite the critical role smallholder's play, and their disproportionate vulnerability to the polycrisis, they often lack basic access to the capital, tools, resources and organizational support to ensure their food sovereignty, reliable livelihoods and ongoing regenerative stewardship of landscapes. Poignant evidence of this is the fact that smallholders currently receive a mere 0.8% of total global climate finance.

 tl;dr Eppie is a community-powered providerless email (with a soft spot for stars ‚≠ê on [GitHub](https://github.com/Eppie-io) üòÅ)
 
 ## The Big Picture ü¶Ñ
 
 Our mission is to take private data away from the servers of the Big Tech and allow users to be independent owners of their identities. We believe that decentralized trustless networks are ready to bring freedom and justice to the Internet. For everyone, not just a few advanced crypto enthusiasts. But first, Web3 needs some more every-day utility. _Like an email_.
 
 ## Here Comes The Communityüéâ
 
 A conventional email has a server. It ""provides the service"" to the users and, along the way, takes full control over their accounts and data. 
 
 Eppie is nothing like that. It operates entirely in a p2p network, where users provide the service to each other. Your messages are encrypted, delivered, and stored by the combined efforts of every user in the system. Why is it better? Your email finally belongs to you.
 
 - Nobody can access it
 - Nobody can prevent you from using it
 - And it is protected ‚Äî not by one server, but by millions of other users machines
 
 With all that said, Eppie is simple, beautiful, easy to set up and use: accept your seed phrase and you are all set. It is compatible with other DID standards and can send messages within Eppie‚Äôs own network or directly to any crypto wallet. Eppie integrages ENS which allows direct communication between ENS addresses *_and_* recieving normal Web2 emails to ENS address.
 
 The client application is also compatible with normal email, so you can keep using you Gmail or Microsoft Outlook along with the decentralized mailbox.

 Connect your existing mailboxes and crypto wallets. Make them public or make them invisible at will.
 
 ## Features
 
 - üåé Works on all platforms: Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, Android
 - üï∂Ô∏è Privacy-first: there's no such thing as optional encryption
 - üöÄ P2P messaging: without servers nobody's holding your hand anymore
 - üîë Identity manager: key management is a breeze
 - üíæ Decentralized backup: your data is safe and only yours
 - ü§ô Ultimate interoperaility: Eppie can communicate with Ethereum, Bitcoin and more
 - üì¨ IMAP/SMTP compatible: connect to Gmail, Microsoft Outlook etc.
 - ü¶Ñ Proton Mail Authentication: Eppie is the first native desktop client capable of that
 - üîê PGP encryption: stay safe even with conventional email
 
 NOTE: the project is early in development, not all of the features are publicly availabe
 
 ## Fun fact üëÄ
 
 Eppie can use conventional email as a name service: so you send a message to Gmail address, but it never lands on the server and goes straight to the decentralized network.
 
 
 ## The Team ü§ì üòæ ü•≥
 
 We are 10 nerds with a passion for decentralized web. Our company is based in Estonia ‚Äî it is one of the best countries in Europe for Web3 project development in terms of legislation. We have been building multi-platform applications for more than 10 years. Our previously released products have 20 million downloads worldwide. Among other things, our programmers are involved in development of [**Beam**](~https://beam.mw/~) ‚Äî confidential cryptocurrency and DeFi platform.

 ## Why You Need Another Email? üì¨
 
 Your mailbox probably stores all sorts of important information ‚Äî on your business and social activity, financial state, health, consumer behavior etc. You might even be using it as an identity provider to log into some crypto exchange and dozens of other services. Email is the core of your digital identity. 
 
 Yet, of 4+ billion email accounts in the world, about 0 belong to users. You log in ‚Äî _the server decides whether to allow you to use your identity or not_. This is a privacy violation by design. Identity naturally belongs to human, it should not be a service.
 
 * Own your messages at all times
  With a decentralized network you never have to trust a server to deliver your message. You create it, you own it. This is guaranteed by the whole community
 
 * Exchange messages with Gmail and Ethereum network
  Eppie will be compatible with conventional email and Ethereum addresses at launch, with many more to come. Switch to Web3 ‚Äî stay connected to everyone.
 
 * Don‚Äôt manage keys, manage contacts
  In Eppie identity management finally makes sense: create an identity card, choose people to share it with ‚Äî so they can message you, not your hash.
 
 * Move your old mailbox to Web3
  Any mailbox including Gmail. Emails and contacts. Make your data truly private by moving it to a decentralized network.
 
 
 ## How Does It Work? ‚öôÔ∏è
 
 The client application encrypts the data, breaks it to pieces and stores them on random nodes of the network ‚Äî the other client machines. The address is also a public key. Only the user can retrieve the data using their matching private key. No one else has access to it, including us, the developers. 
 
 And no one has the authority to allow or disallow a user into their account. The decision is made on your machine, locally. _Whoever owns the key, owns the mailbox_.
 
 
 ## Project Updates üèó
 
 ![image](http://finebits.com/apps/eppie/eppie4.jpg)

 ## Summary 
 We are pushing the boundaries of decentralized governance by developing a novel protocol that empowers DAOs and communities to make informed, equitable decisions. 
 
 Our protocol leverages cryptographic advancements and social science insights to establish a ranking system based on agent interactions, fostering a more engaging, secure, and meritocratic decision-making process.
 
 ## Problem
 Current DAO governance models often suffer from low participation, centralization, and susceptibility to manipulation. These challenges hinder the full potential of decentralized organizations and can lead to inefficient or unfair outcomes.
 
 ### Not just DAOs
 
 We argue this is not a blockchain specific problem. **Communities do not scale**, they lose efficiency as they grow bigger, delve in internal & external politics, conflicts and forget what they were about. 
 
 We argue that web technologies, an *infinite garden* of Ethereum, the cypherpunk is an answer, 
 
 ## Solution 
 Our autonomous competence identification protocol addresses these issues by:
 
 - **Tokenizing Competence**: Participants earn reputation tokens based on their contributions and ability to align with group preferences.
 - **Composable Architecture**: Enables the creation of interconnected DAOs, promoting specialization and adaptability.
 - **Privacy Preservation**: Protects individual preferences while ensuring transparency and accountability.
 - **Resistance to Manipulation**: Mitigates risks of collusion and Sybil attacks through game-theoretic mechanisms.
 
 
 # Impact 
 Our protocol has the potential to revolutionize governance in DAOs and beyond. By fostering a more engaging, equitable, and secure decision-making process, we can empower communities to achieve their goals and unlock the full potential of decentralized collaboration.
 
 # Grant Purpose
 
 This grant will enable us to:
 - **Continue Research**: Refine the protocol's theoretical foundations and explore its applicability in various domains.
 - **Develop Applications**: Build user-friendly integrations for popular communication platforms like Telegram, Discord, Farcaster, and Slack.
 - **Foster Adoption**: Engage with the community, gather feedback, and drive the adoption of the protocol in real-world DAOs.

 **GITCOIN FUNDS USAGE**
 
 Gitcoin funds will be used to fund, organize, and design more ecosystem regeneration projects. Our upcoming projects are:
 
 Q1 2025- Debris Removal & Shoreline Stabilization for Leatherback Turtles in Dorado, Puerto Rico: We are partnering with Chelonia PR, a leading turtle conservation organization in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, to restore a critical nesting beach for Leatherback Turtles. This past nesting season saw a notable decline in nesting activity, which Chelonia attributes to an increase in debris on the beach due to a nearby dredging project. To address this issue, we will utilize heavy-duty vehicles to clear large debris from the beach, creating a safer nesting environment for the turtles. In addition to debris removal, we will focus on stabilizing the shoreline by restoring the natural dune system. This will help mitigate the impacts of erosion and maintain the integrity of the nesting habitat, ensuring long-term protection for the turtles and other coastal wildlife.
 
 Q2 2025- Water Flow Restoration for Everglades National Park in Florida, United States: In collaboration with the Miccosukee Tribe, we will undertake a wetland restoration project aimed at restoring natural water flow within Everglades National Park. This project will address the disruptions to water circulation that have impacted the park‚Äôs delicate ecosystem. By reestablishing natural hydrology, we aim to improve habitat quality for native wildlife and help rejuvenate the unique biodiversity of this iconic wetland. The Miccosukee Tribe‚Äôs deep-rooted knowledge and expertise will guide our efforts, ensuring that we integrate culturally-informed restoration practices that respect the land and its history. Through targeted interventions such as re-channeling water flows and restoring wetland vegetation, we are committed to promoting ecological resilience and supporting the Everglades' long-term health.
 
 All Gitcoin funds will go towards funding regenerative projects that we complete ourselves and all costs associated with these projects are publicly available on our website.
 
 **ROADMAP**
 
 We ultimately want to build a large base of subscribers and funding so that we can regularly allocate large sums of capital towards all types of projects that benefit our ecosystems including Reforestation, Wetland Restoration, Solar Farms, Coral Reef Gardening, etc.

In flowing capital to support regeneration (instead of extraction) and prioritizing accountability to community and nature (instead of profit) - we will shape new patterns of being in reciprocity with the land and each other.
 
 Given this, we focus on how we resource the local-led innovations that will allow watersheds across this bioregion to demonstrate what a more hopeful and thriving future could look like. Money is energy, and empowering local people to self-determine what it means to thrive will involve radically changing how capital flows to grassroots efforts. 
 
 CoLabs grows its impact through the formation of small, distributed collaborations (Labs). These Labs each have their specific approach to flowing finance to bioregions - but work as a family of collaborators to cross pollinate ideas, relationships, and collective momentum with each other. Each of our Labs contains a full spectrum of collaborators, offering a synergy of perspectives.

 To move our current economy towards valuing and rewarding regeneration - each of our Labs is focused on launching an initiative with one or more of these three key areas of innovation: **the rights of nature to thrive, ecosystem service markets, and governance that is in service to life**. Funds raised from the BioFi Pathfinder GitCoin round will be used to support the ongoing operations of our Labs. 
 **Some of our active Labs include**:
 
 **Okanagan Catalyst Network**
 + The Okanagan bioregion is the food basket of British Columbia and its waters feeds the Columbia and Fraser Rivers Basins. Through the [Bringing the Salmon Home](https://columbiariversalmon.ca/) partnership across three First Nations (Sylix Okanagan, Ktunaxa, and¬†Secw√©pemc), they have brought sockeye salmon back to the Okanagan from a low of 3,000 (25 years ago) to 800,000 this year making up 70% of the sockeye that returned to the Columbia River basin - the mightiest salmon river in the world. The story of renewal and regeneration here is inspiring, and tremendous but also vulnerable to the loss of government funding and industrial agriculture.¬†We are working with and weaving together impact investors, university partners, producers, food businesses, indigenous entrepreneurs, and industry associations to identify strategic investments and unite local people into a One Okanagan alliance that supports,¬†values, and regeneratively finances the work of people who are stewarding the land, waters, and salmon of this place.¬†To find out more, please visit [our Notion page](https://edgefinance.notion.site/Financing-Bioregional-Communities-4d143b0b784543829ee43b3c86507eac).

 **Salmon Nation Rematriation Fund**
 + Governing how financial resources flow is a key issue of our time. How do we come together as a people to make decisions on behalf of future generations of all life in this bioregion? How do we invest financial resources in ways that honor people and place? The Rematriation Fund will focus on capitalizing a fund and convening indigenous women across the Salmon Nation bioregion and beyond to innovate governance values, principles, structure, and processes that honor the rights of nature to thrive and how humans as part of nature can be in rights relations with the land and each other. It is intended that the living example of this Fund will inspire and cross pollinate similar bioregional funds across Salmon Nation and beyond.

 # Our Bioregion of Home
 Salmon Nation is a bioregion defined by the traditional extent of wild Pacific salmon in North American - from the Salinas River in California to the North Slopes of Alaska. Salmon show us how we are connected to the land, the waters and each other. In this bioregion defined by salmon - indigenous people are reclaiming meaningful relationships to their lands and waters on their own terms, and playing an increasingly influential role in their territories‚Äô cultural, economic, scientific and legal evolution. It is also where a symbiosis is emerging between old and new ways of living, of two-eyed seeing through both indigenous knowledge and western perspectives, of re-interpreting ‚Äî through art, song, theater, new media, language, and unlikely collaborations in all manner of experiments at the watershed level ‚Äî how we share wisdom and resources in ways that are more equitable, and ultimately richer and more meaningful for people and place.
 
 # History/Context
 The idea of Salmon Nation has been around for 30+ years through an organization called [Ecotrust](http://www.ecotrust.org), founded in 1992 by Spencer Beebe. One of the first bioregional organizations to serve people and place, Ecotrust‚Äôs focused on the Salmon Nation bioregion using a triple-bottom line approach to all its work - environment, equity, and economy. Cheryl Chen, the founder of CoLabs spent 12+ years working at Ecotrust in several capacities and is a founding partner of the [Salmon Nation Trust](http://www.salmonnation.net) - a public benefit company whose purpose is to inspire, enable, and invest in regenerative development in our home. She is also a founding member of the [Magic Canoe](http://www.magiccanoe.org), a non profit dedicated to amplifying and uplifting stories of hope, connection, and ‚Äòwhat works‚Äô in Salmon Nation. Even though Salmon Nation CoLabs is a new venture, it has spawned from decades of deep relationships and trust building under the Salmon Nation bioregional frame.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/18/3

 ""Register vitalik.eth for 3 years"": it is possibile to register an ens with a prompt (coming at the end of april)
 
 ""Renew vitalik.eth for 3 years"": it is possibile to renew a registered ens (coming at the end of april)
 
 ""Is vitalik.eth available?"": check if an ens is available (coming at the end of april)
 
 ""when does vitalik.eth expire?"": check your ens expiration (coming at the end of april)
 
 You can also do multiple operations like:
 
 ""Register these two ens: vitalik.eth and limone.eth"" (coming at the end of april)
 
 ""Register vitalik.eth for 1 year and renew limone.eth for two years"" (coming at the end of april)
 
 We'll continuously add new ENS-related actions (e.g., subdomain registration) and work on user intent recognition, offering the market an easy and innovative solution for registering an ENS!
 
 
 2) Brian Public Knowledge base:
 In our public knowledge base we have added several ens docs, allowing users to search info like ""what is ens?"" ""what is the ens registry?""
 
 This is already available both on the brian app and brian api. 
 
 We can also launch a new kb dedicated only to the ENS ecosystem. On this custom-built kb we can add specific docs, articles, github repos, etc., allowing users to ask more in-depth questions.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/642/30

 Our Mission
 Silvi is dedicated to restoring the Kakamega Forest, the remaining tropical rainforest in East Africa. Our mission is to support the trillion tree restoraring movement and to enhance biodiversity while empowering local communities by providing them with the tools and resources needed for sustainable ecological stewardship.
 
 About Kakamega Forest
 The Kakamega Forest is a critical ecosystem rich in biodiversity, home to numerous endemic species of flora and fauna. However, it faces significant threats from deforestation, illegal logging, and habitat degradation. Our project focuses on reversing these negative impacts by planting native trees and rehabilitating the forest ecosystem.
 [![Mau-Update-6.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/XYxyyXT7/Mau-Update-6.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/18nzkRmL)
 
 Our efforts in Kakamega have paralleled the technolofy developement at Silvi and we see this site as our flagship demostration project. We are excited to apply the technology we've built over the last 2 years towards the most sophisticated methodology yet.
 
 Last year, we had the chance of visiting Kakamega in person and meeting the stewards using the Silvi App.

GG22,GG22 OSS - Developer Tooling and Libraries,ZK Email,0x35292bbd442373046a6fb4bF7e2529FA9A8D5Bb0,https://twitter.com/proofofemail,https://github.com/zkemail,ZK Email,https://prove.email,APPROVED,"ZK Email is a set of open source SDKs, libraries, and protocols (https://prove.email) that support making anonymous proofs of redacted existing emails on chain. This is useful for provenant proofs, by directly verifying SHA-RSA signatures from your emails within ZK. It can be used for proof of twitter account, proof of github contribution, and to make KYCs on Airbnb/Coinbase etc portable -- all of which have open source prototypes now, without centralized attesters (see prove.email for links). Our code, roadmap, and ideas are fully open source at https://github.com/zkemail.
 
 We finished and are currently auditing https://github.com/zkemail/ether-email-auth, which lets any developer specify how they want to parse a subject in Solidity, and use that to build a new zk-email enabled app on-chain in 10 lines of Solidity.
 
 We used this to build account recovery modules for wallets, which is live for Gnosis Safes at prove.email/recovery , which allows anyone to add an email address as a decentralized guardian for their wallets. We discussed this at ZK Summit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZTNzvLXB14 .
 
 We also built email wallet (demo: https://emailwallet.org, docs: http://docs.emailwallet.org) as an open standard and protocol that anyone can plug into -- it allows you to use your email as a wallet signer, allowing much easier onboarding onto Ethereum. In addition, plaintext emails serve as a one-click replacement for hot wallets, for signing and sending transactions. It also lets anyone send any NFT directly to any email address. We also released 2 factor authentication via email signers on Safes using emailwallet.org (https://prove.email/blog/2fa) and general email-login based authentication modules via email wallet (https://zkemail.gitbook.io/zk-email/login-with-zk-email-oauth-api).
 
 We think this is the future of provenant identity proofs on Ethereum, as well as the future of simple wallet interfaces to onboard new people to crypto via emails. 
 
 We rely only on pre-existing cryptography and our bespoke, highly optimized ZK proofs to verify your mailserver's signatures -- there is no centralized computation, MPCs, trusted hardware, or attestations. Only trust smart contracts, email, and DNS infrastructure.
 
 Note that the primary developers on the project are funded by grants from Ethereum Foundation's Privacy and Scaling Explorations group, and initial development was funded by 0xPARC. Gitcoin money will go towards hiring developers to contribute, travel expenses for folks working on the project, and funding hackathon prizes to encourage folks to build atop the protocol, as these are not included in our primary grants. 
 
 UPDATE July 2024:
 Thanks to your support on Gitcoin, we were able to achieve a number of key goals. With that money, we built and hosted registry.prove.email, which is a public key archive of 1M+ DKIM public keys. We were also able to fund development https://registry-dev.zkregex.com/, which is a beta version of a tool that lets you construct a new zk email proof by just specifying a 10 line JSON configuration with your regex details (docs at https://zkemail.gitbook.io/zk-email/zk-email-sdk). We were also able to fund travel of one of our developers to Brussels for EthCC, in order for him to build at the hackathon and strategize with the team. We spent a previous Gitcoin grant on infrastructure development for our relayer.

 The work is entirely open source. Previous work has led to a number of impactful open source contributions in the zk space including:
 - The first RSA-SHA256 circuit in halo2
 - The first ZK Regex circuits and libraries, in circom and halo2: https://github.com/zkemail/zk-regex
 - Halo2 Benchmarking: We have open sourced a halo2 wasm benchmarking repo that runs any halo2 wasm code in the browser on 100 instances in parallel for any browser on any operating system (mobile or desktop), and spits out the mean running time and variance -- we intend to publish this as an easy to use Cargo and NPM package soon for others to use.
 - Halo2 Optimizations: We have various halo2 circuits to split verifiers, divide circuits for faster parallel client side proving, and many others. We have in addition contributed back to various open source libraries in the ecosystem.
 - Educational content: We have created a set of blog posts (https://prove.email/blog), talks, and docs (https://prove.email/docs) around our experiences, including generic ZK breakdowns and explainers such as https://prove.email/blog/zk .
 - Circom Hash to Curve on the Grumpkin Curve: Our circuits enable proving the private set intersection (PSI) protocol in ZK, which we use for decentralized relayer communication, so that relayers cannot censor unfavorable queries.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/609/31

In the urban and suburban context, we do this by dispersing regeneration across multiple locations. We design, build and integrate organic farms into these properties and connect them through an on-chain food trading network.
 
 We currently have 11 property owners signed-up and the number is quickly growing. We are excited to see an increasing number of people interested in growing their own food and the ones that already do, love giving to their neighbors and family members. 
 [![Map.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Bvr744Wg/Map.png)](https://postimg.cc/8Fbmb8zJ)
 
 With the **Food Trading Network** we aim to not only create localized community and interaction, but also provide an ROI for the investors and donors, whether is cash or impact. Our blockchain-enabled platform will optimize the coordination of funds, providers, and property owners, thus enabling an accelerated growth of regeneration.

 First, we would like to explain our long term vision in terms of design.
 
 Our initial projects include green roofs and green walls with low maintenance edible gardens and hydroponic systems that can be integrated to any type of structures. With bigger homes, as it is common in suburbs, we can also integrate mini-food forests in the yards. Here below an example:
 
 [![ecoterium-A-large-modern-home-in-Palo-Alto-California-With-wha-582ae0cf-7535-4009-9da7-19a8cbf01d2f.png](https://i.postimg.cc/QMB9cK4X/ecoterium-A-large-modern-home-in-Palo-Alto-California-With-wha-582ae0cf-7535-4009-9da7-19a8cbf01d2f.png)](https://postimg.cc/CZgxg5pt)
 
 With **Building Integrated Farming (BIF)** and permaculture we can grow more healthy / localized food in Cities. And it becomes more advanced with bigger buildings such as a condominium building where we can house plants, people and create biodiverse habitats.
 
 [![ecoterium-A-2-3-story-mixed-used-building-with-modern-organic-c-6195e692-0148-4ab5-9517-ef630ab9ac4c.png](https://i.postimg.cc/XJfz7q08/ecoterium-A-2-3-story-mixed-used-building-with-modern-organic-c-6195e692-0148-4ab5-9517-ef630ab9ac4c.png)](https://postimg.cc/njLk3Hrj)
 
 
 We have been working on designs with the BIF concept for over decade and during that time we discovered the **Solarpunk** movement which we clearly align with. Having this trajectory we believe that we are now very close to making Solarpunk environments a reality, especially in the the denser parts of cities. Here below, examples of farms integrated in small warehouses, restaurants or shops, and mixed used buildings. 
 
 [![Warehouse-Apartment-02-v01.png](https://i.postimg.cc/66HhVnzZ/Warehouse-Apartment-02-v01.png)](https://postimg.cc/PNwZTLgf)
 
 As the trend and the network grows, we will have the opportunity to partner with larger real estate developers, especially when the blockchain and **ReFi** movements develop wholistic capital that can generate the means to build regenerative skyscrapers and city blocks.

 We are also in the last stages of permitting for two adjacent single family homes with green roofs, green walls and shared mini-forest. And also a home addition with a hydroponics carport (more info about this on our website). 
 
 [![Melvin-Screenshot-2024-10-23-004655.png](https://i.postimg.cc/qvDjb68t/Melvin-Screenshot-2024-10-23-004655.png)](https://postimg.cc/K1LP4zpF)
 
 In recent months, we have been developing a model of relocatable raised beds with edible plants, fruit trees and vines that could be used for temporary facilities such as emergency housing.

 By maximizing the number of Urban House Farms in both existing and new properties, and connecting them through a trading network, we are taking regenerative actions that align with values such as:
 * **Food security, health, and regenerative sustainability:** By growing a surplus of organic food locally.
 * **Community and collaboration:** By creating an interactive trading and worker network.
 * **Stewardship and biodiversity:** By restoring ecosystems through increasing natural capital and creating biodiverse habitats in urban areas.
 * **Innovation:** By influencing planning, design, and construction to be more regenerative, and adding transparency and efficiency through blockchain technology.
 
 We are engaged in regenerative design and construction, permaculture, and organic farming, focused on restoring ecosystems and local food production. We support local trading with transparency and low fuel use, and build community through collaboration. Using **DMRV**, we ensure transparency and track the impact of our regenerative actions. Funding will help scale these efforts and enhance our trading network.
 
 Our team combines architecture, solar, permaculture, construction, real estate development, ReFi, data science, networking and sales expertise.

 We are considering including the following assessments to provide a clear picture of our project's effectiveness and contributions to regeneration:
 
 1. **Ecological Impact Assessment:** Biodiversity Metrics, Soil Health
 
 2. **Social Impact Assessment:** Community Engagement Levels, Food Security
 
 3. **Economic Impact Assessment:** Local Economic Activity, Cost Savings 
 
 4. **Sustainability Metrics:** Carbon Footprint, Resource Use Efficiency
 
 5. **Regenerative Design Metrics:** Building Performance, Resilience Indicators
 
 6. **Stakeholder Feedback:** Surveys and Interviews
 
 7. **Long-term Monitoring:** Continuous Monitoring Programs

 We believe our work is crucial not only for urban spaces but for the planet as a whole. Cities, where most of the world's population lives and grows, have a significant negative environmental impact. Our work aims to reverse that by making cities regenerative.
 
 With additional funding, we can expand our efforts to make more projects regenerative, scale up to hundreds of proposals to property owners and developers, and build an important and functioning regenerative food network. 
 
 **Join Us in Regenerating Cities!**
 
 By contributing to Urban House Farms, you are helping transform urban spaces into regenerative, thriving ecosystems. Together, we can accelerate and maximize regeneration while influencing and making an impact now, and creating the cities of the future. This is our line of work, and we reinvest our revenues into furthering regeneration. No matter what, we will continue - but every contribution, no matter the size, directly fuels our passion to make cities regenerative and resilient.

GG22,GG22 OSS - dApps and Apps,Mybucks.online,0x620dc94C842817d5d8b8207aa2DdE4f8C8b73415,https://twitter.com/mybucks_online,https://github.com/mybucks-online,Mybucks.online,https://mybucks.online,APPROVED,"# Introduction
 
 [Mybucks.online](https://mybucks.online) is a **password-only, self-custodial cryptocurrency wallet**. It **generates a private key from your password** using an industry-standard, verified one-way hash function. **Your private key forms your account**, allowing you to transfer, receive, and hold your crypto assets permanently.
 
 To further enhance security, it utilizes the **scrypt** Key Derivation Function (KDF). This mechanism increases the computational effort required to crack passwords, effectively delaying brute-force attacks and making them impractical.
 
 It **fully runs on your browser side without** using any storage or invoking any third-party APIs for key management. It instantly generates your private key from your password input, and whenever you close or refresh, **there is no footprint**. This absolutely protects your privacy.
 
 # How it works
 
 The **password** is the primary field used to generate a private key and create your account. To **avoid password duplication** among users, we have also introduced a shorter secondary field called the **passcode**, which is about 6 characters long.
 
 By **combining the password and passcode**, we can achieve strong randomness, ensuring the safety of your account. Additionally, the passcode serves as a confirmation step when backing up your credentials or transferring assets.
 
 ![How it works](https://mybucks.online/assets/images/encrypt.png)
 
 # Key generation
 
 The minimal JavaScript code used to **generate a private key from password and passcode inputs** is shown below. You can generate your private key directly without using mybucks.online.
 
 Here, the **password** is a traditional input that must be at least 12 characters long and include a combination of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The **passcode** is a shorter input, at least 6 characters long, used to **prevent account duplication** due to **password reuse** and also as a confirmation for secure areas.
 
 ```javascript
 import { Buffer } from ""buffer"";
 import { ethers } from ""ethers"";
 import { scrypt } from ""scrypt-js"";
 
 const HASH_OPTIONS = {
  N: 32768, // CPU/memory cost parameter, 2^15
  r: 8, // block size parameter
  p: 5, // parallelization parameter
  keyLen: 64,
 };
 
 async function generatePrivateKey(password, passcode) {
  const salt = password.slice(-4) + passcode
 
  const passwordBuffer = Buffer.from(password);
  const saltBuffer = Buffer.from(salt);
 
  const hashBuffer = await scrypt(
  passwordBuffer,
  saltBuffer,
  HASH_OPTIONS.N,
  HASH_OPTIONS.r,
  HASH_OPTIONS.p,
  HASH_OPTIONS.keyLen,
  (p) => console.log(Math.floor(p * 100))
  );
  const hashHex = Buffer.from(hashBuffer).toString(""hex"");
  const privateKey = ethers.keccak256(abi.encode([""string""], [hashHex]));
 
  return privateKey;
 }
 ```
 
 You can find the code [here](https://github.com/mybucks-online/key-generation/blob/master/index.js). You can download the repository and execute it on your local machine as a backup for account generation.

GG22,Land Regenerators,South Rift Association of Land Owners,0x97A9b7914415E2C7C2bC17165fB78289B0ADd554,https://twitter.com/SORALOorg,https://github.com/,South Rift Association of Land Owners,https://www.soralo.org/,APPROVED,"Restoring Kenya's South Rift Valley Through Community-Led Land Regeneration
 
 ## Introduction: Who We Are
 **South Rift Association of Land Owners (SORALO)** is a community-based land trust established in the year 2007. It comprises 25 Maasai communities living between the Greater Maasai Mara and the Greater Amboseli ecosystems (approximately 15,000 square kilometers). The community-based land trust was founded with a vision of maintaining a healthy, intact, and connected landscape in the south rift that sustains both the pastoralist communities and wildlife.
 
 SORALO is dedicated to fostering harmony between wildlife and communities across Kenya‚Äôs South Rift. We believe that people and nature can coexist and thrive together. By empowering local communities and using sustainable land restoration techniques, we aim to preserve the rich biodiversity of our landscapes while enhancing the livelihoods of those who depend on them.
 
 ## Problem Statement
 Habitat loss, land fragmentation, and land degradation are the most immediate threats facing the South Rift Valley landscape. Over the last 30 years, transitions in land tenure from communal to individual ownership have led to the subdivision of communal rangelands, which are subsequently sold off and fenced. This process disrupts migratory corridors and limits mobility, a key survival mechanism for both pastoralists and wildlife in the landscape (Mwangi & Ostrom, 2009). As a result, traditional grazing lands have become increasingly restricted, heightening pressure on the remaining rangeland, water, and forest resources.
 
 Rapid population growth (5.3% per annum) and a youthful population eager to secure rights to resources fuel the demand for individual land parcels (Bedelian et al., 2019; Western et al., 2020). While communal grazing systems are still prevalent, the shift to individual land titles reduces the space available for communal livestock rearing. The cumulative effect of these changes has resulted in a reduction of land for both pastoralists and wildlife, while intensifying the strain on the region‚Äôs natural resources.
 
 Compounding these challenges, changing rainfall patterns, rising temperatures, and more intense grazing are accelerating land degradation across the region. Droughts are becoming more frequent, further exacerbating the degradation of rangelands and increasing water scarcity. Projections suggest that over the next decade, these combined factors will result in a 12-14% loss of suitable cattle grazing land (Bedelian et al., 2019).
 
 In addition to ecological threats, the slow erosion of Maasai cultural practices and governance institutions is undermining effective natural resource management. Traditional communal governance systems are struggling to adapt to modern demands, weakening the checks and balances that have historically protected biodiversity and natural resources.
 
 ## Solutions
 
 ### 1. FMNR/PMNR
 A targeted training program and awareness campaign will be implemented to activate smallholder farmers to adopt Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR) and activating herder communities to adopt Pastoralist Managed Natural Regeneration (PMNR), regenerating and protecting trees from stumps or seeds.
 
 The program will engage 12 Champions (2 or 3 per community sublocation) in four community locations. They will be trained on F/PMNR, monitoring, leadership, and climate change mitigation. The Champions will receive three 4-day trainings. Champions will aim to reach 1,747 households and regenerate over 26,000 trees annually. Monitoring will be done via smartphones and booklets.
 
 ### 2. Grass Seed Bank Development
 We will collaborate with local communities to establish a 20-acre grass seedbank, owned and managed by a group of women from the surrounding households. This initiative aims to empower women while enhancing ecological restoration and improving livelihoods.
 
 The seedbank will be stocked with seeds purchased from existing women‚Äôs groups, and the reseeding will be done by 10 women over 4 days. This initiative will ensure a steady supply of locally adapted grass species for ongoing restoration efforts.
 
 ### 3. Pasture Regeneration through Earth Smiles
 To restore degraded rangelands, we will engage local community members in constructing 1,600 earth smiles (small, curved embankments) to capture water and prevent soil erosion. These will cover 40 acres and be reseeded using grass from the seedbanks. Community members will be compensated for their labor, fostering local ownership and long-term ecological resilience.

 I'm Diogo Jorge, a Brazillian forest gardener, founder of AgroforestDAO. Allow me to share a bit of my story in the Ethereum ecosystem ü´ò
 
 I have been spreading syntropic agroforestry systems here in rural Minas Gerais - Brazil where together with my family we practice [Permaculture](https://moradaviva.wordpress.com/), have hosted 50+ volunteers from the web2 network [Wwoof](https://wwoof.net/) and ran projects with local [NGOs](https://projetonossahorta.blogspot.com/).
 
 I started my Web3 journey in 2022 via [Kernel0x](https://www.kernel.community/), an educational fellowship supported by the Ethereum Community, where I learned so much and was able to participate as a grantee in Gitcoin Rounds and as a donor in Octant Epochs

 In the same year I connected with ReFiDAO and participated in the [Planet Positive Hackathon](https://blog.refidao.com/planet-positive-nft-hackathon/).
 [![planetpositive.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/MTjtHXJL/planetpositive.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/MMq1r6T0)
 
 I was part of a team whose project was minting Agricultural Journals as NFTs that could have different use cases, such as monetization or reputation building, and thanks to the amazing support of Magenta Ceiba (Bloom Network), Darina (Coffee Carbon) and the team of Sunshine Validator (Regen Network) we created an NFT on Stargaze and got [3rd place](https://www.loom.com/share/5885b066dca84ce981104be56e57eb1e) ü•≥ 
 
 To receive the prize we created our first Safe Multisig. After a call with Pranav Khana I decided to start building community around the topic of Agroforestry and DAOs on Twitter while learning about DAO tooling, coordination for public goods, onboarding brazilians, and fundraising.

GG22,GG22 OSS - dApps and Apps,Toban -ÂΩìÁï™-,0x6a245A9DDA257e45f532AA4BBed46E6D9F480B82,https://twitter.com/0xtoban,https://github.com/hackdays-io,Toban -ÂΩìÁï™-,https://github.com/hackdays-io/toban,APPROVED,"# Overview
 
 Toban is a DAO Tool that realizes the simplest and most effective way of recording contributions and distributing rewards. It supports contribution tracking and reward distribution in a way that aligns with the operational needs of internet-native collaborative activities.
 It mainly aims to support sustainable activities in open-source software (OSS) communities, collaborative art creation, and DAO-based regional revitalization projects. By providing role-based contribution tracking and reward distribution based on contribution levels, Toban promotes the long-term growth of communities.
 
 # Objective
 
 Toban's objective is to provide a system where every contribution in internet-native collaborations is recognized and properly evaluated, leading to sustainable activities.
 Projects and communities conducted over the internet have the potential to create new value through the collaboration of diverse individuals, unrestricted by distance or time. However, volunteer and remote-based contributions often go undervalued, and the lack of proper reward mechanisms can make it difficult to sustain participation. Toban aims to increase the number of projects where contributions are recorded and visualized so that participants are recognized and rewarded.
 
 Additionally, although Toban originated in Japan, it is being developed in collaboration with contributors from across Asia, ensuring interoperability with global DAO tools and protocols. This allows Toban to offer a unique approach rooted in Japanese and Asian culture while also providing new insights and perspectives to other global projects.
 
 # Features
 
 While there are other DAO tools for tracking contributions and distributing rewards, Toban's key feature is its ""Role-Based Rewards Distribution"" system. 
 Traditional task-based contribution tracking often becomes cumbersome and prone to being overlooked, making it difficult to sustain.
 Peer-based evaluation systems can also introduce subjective bias, sometimes leading to all participants being rated similarly, diluting the value of the evaluation.
 There are also tools that calculate contribution scores based on activity on platforms like GitHub or Discord, but these struggle to capture contributions made outside the platform.
 
 Toban addresses these issues through the following elements:
 
 - Contribution Tracking: Toban records contributions based on slightly abstracted ""roles"" while also offering a mechanism to capture smaller contributions through P2P token distribution.
 - Reward Distribution: When a project generates revenue or receives donations, Toban calculates contribution levels based on contribution time, P2P token balances, and role-based weighting, automatically distributing rewards. The system is built using tools like Splits and Superfluid to manage ERC20 and native tokens.
 - Interoperability: Toban is designed to be interoperable with other DAO tools and protocols, such as Hats Protocol, DAOHAUS, and ENS, enabling flexible decision-making and reward distribution that scale with the community‚Äôs size and growth.
 
 # Target Users
 
 - Communities or project teams involved in internet-native activities
 - DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) or communities looking to implement contribution-based reward systems
 - Projects aiming to automate contribution tracking and evaluation, boosting participant motivation
 
 # Roadmap
 
 - 2024.09: Release of smart contracts and CLI prototype
 - 2024.10: Start of internal proof-of-concept testing
 - 2024.11: Release of the web interface prototype and introduction to external projects
 - 2024.12: Collection of user feedback and feature improvements
 - 2025.01: Beta release on the mainnet
 - 2025.02: Expansion of the user and developer community
 
 ## Development Stage
 
 Toban is currently in the prototype phase and is being developed as an open-source project. Contributions from the developer community are being encouraged through GitHub, and the system is being tested and improved through real-world projects.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/608/33

 Block explorers function as the de facto front-end for blockchain data. They provide transparency for transaction, block, address, and contract information, as well as analytical insights into transfers, block times, gas prices, and accounts. They display essential context for additional project data, token information, and related tags.
 
 Block explorers also support blockchain developers through API access, contract verification, and contract interaction tools. For Layer 2s, they serve not only the L2 transaction data but also provide views of the underlying L1 data so that users can get the complete picture as batches travel between layers.
 
 Block explorers are integral infrastructure for a decentralized ecosystem. At Blockscout, we build an open-source explorer that can be used by all EVM chains. Chains are free to fork Blockscout, customize it as they see fit, and use it to support their network. 
 
 # Open-source block explorers are a vital public good
 Just as we need multiple clients for Ethereum, we need multiple explorers and tooling diversity for the Ethereum and rollup ecosystem. If (or when) an explorer is down, others are there to step in and support.
 
 This redundancy is important, but it is not Blockscout's sole mission. Our mission is to provide a first-class, open-source, decentralized explorer for all users‚Äîan explorer built by and for the community that can provide everything users, developers, and projects need to successfully explore and develop on a chain.
 
 Over the past year, we've been working hard on Blockscout. Thanks to community contributions, we've optimized Blockscout for speed while overhauling the front-end for ease of use. We've introduced tools to make smart contract verification much easier and added tagging, account functionality, marketplace features, and more.
 
 With your help, we will continue adding tools and features to support Ethereum and the network of L2s and L3s building on top.
 
 # Open-source explorers support the entire ecosystem
 
 EVM blockchains and L2s including zk rollups and optimistic rollups need open-source explorers and tooling to support: 
 - Freely available data
 - Data accuracy checks
 - Redundancy and resiliency 
 - Community-driven features, customizations and innovations
 - Transparency
 - Quick, cost-effective implementation, especially for testnets
 - Small chain and niche chain support
 - Consistent multi-chain experience
 - Ongoing, fast feature development
 - Trustlessness and auditability
 - Security through malicious contract and address labelling, and security scoring for contracts.
 
 # Blockscout is a community-driven solution

 Blockscout has been in production for more than 6 years. We continue to build and improve an open-source explorer used by 600+ chains in the space including most testnets + a hosted [Ethereum mainnet](https://eth.blockscout.com/) and testnet instances provided as public goods. 
 
 Blockscout is used by all types of chains to quickly spin up an instance and provide transactional transparency right away for their users. We continue to make strides with our interface, indexing speed and optimization, and your help is vital to continued improvements and development.

 Through contributions from previous Gitcoin Grants Round we've been able to fully open-source the Blockscout UI, introduce MyAccount, create the DAppscout marketplace and provide ENS support! 
 
 We are continuing to work on our project roadmap for the remainder of the year to include better AA (account abstraction) and DA (Data Availability) support. We are also working on a multichain explorer environment designed to help tie the diverse ecosystem of L1s, L2s and L3s together.
 
 You can learn more about additional items we are working on (or to make a suggestion or get involved), please see our [Roadmap](https://docs.blockscout.com/about/roadmap) and the [Blockscout Docs](https://docs.blockscout.com). 
 
 As we continue to decentralize the future, the tools and infrastructure supporting decentralization must also follow this pattern. We appreciate your funding to support an open-source, premium block explorer - by and for the community!

 GainForest is a decentralized science non-profit that develops equitable nature tech to measure, support and evaluate global conservation.
 
 We work together with communities and non-profit organizations on the ground to give them the tools they need to measure and prove the impact of their environmental efforts. Our products include bioacoustic analysis, remote sensing tools, and AI Assistants that help capture oral knowledge. Once the environmental data is input into our platform, we then produce environmental insights and metrics that can be used to visualize environmental impact.

 ## Capacity Building 
 
 We work together with local communities to co-design environmental data collection and research.
 
 Our ""communities first"" principle is demonstrated through our comprehensive capacity building program, which has already conducted 13 workshops across multiple countries. 
 
 In communities like Aldeia Inha√¢-b√©, local leaders who initially participated in our workshops now conduct their own training sessions and lead technology implementation.

 # Regenerative R&D
 
 FINANCE
 
 I created a beginner class called ‚ÄúHow Do I Crypto‚Äù to help people learn to set up a wallet, so they can be paid by our Local Actions Rewards which I also helped design the process for and training around. Local Action Rewards pay grant funds based on the hourly earning of our token FLO, which pays out to local Bloom hub members performing tangible and documented climate impacts around the world.
 
 TECHNOLOGY & SYSTEMS
 
 I was instrumental in designing Bloom's decentralized global governance model for how our social network is owned and governed by Local Bloom hubs, as well as how we plan to facilitate global industry transformation as we scale larger.
 
 I was a volunteer technical project manager for a year in 2021-2022 to codesign and build our platform at www.bloomnetwork.earth, and I feel incredibly humbled and grateful for the parts of myself that I see there, represented alongside this beautiful work everyone is doing in climate impact, social justice and food systems transformation.
 
 I created an automated workflow for registering new local Bloom hubs, and helped it get translated into Spanish and French. I orchestrated volunteer days with a cloud computing firm I worked at previously, and recruited an engineer from there who helped us to architect the Bloom platform and manifest into an online reality the dreams of this community that has been with us since its conception in 2009.
 
 # Education & Growth
 
 As mentioned previously, I created a beginner class called ‚ÄúHow Do I Crypto‚Äù to help people learn to set up a wallet, and have created countless other trainings over the years to help people learn the basics of what we do at Bloom.
 
 I function as a systems admin, orienting people to the landscape of Bloom, the marketing materials available and how to navigate in our now enormous body of regenerative culture work and play.
 
 I helped design our Calls to Bloom, in which we send out recruitment when we are ready to take on new Blooms and continue to build the network, which is at 28+ Blooms on every continent right now. We hope to make it past 100 by the end of 2026, connecting regenerative culture efforts with support and funding in every bioregion on the planet. Once we attain the reach and permanence intended we will intensify our efforts to become stewards towards and activists for water protection worldwide.
 
 # Operational Support
 
 I have been instrumental in creating and helping design and manage operations for Bloom Network. In the early days of the network I secured volunteer GoToWebinar channels to facilitate our global connection and used my skills as an expert facilitator to ensure connections were fruitful and long-lasting. 
 
 As time went on I architected many of our systems we use to manage the network and also helped with initial design for theory and UI on the platform at www.bloomnetwork.earth. 15 years later our beautiful community has stayed together and planted things that we hope will bloom always, not just priceless relationships but also flowers, gardens, projects, businesses and so much more.
 
 I secured a Digital Marketing Intern in 2022 who helped us put together a branding guide and hone our beautiful design system, which I also codesigned over the last 15 years. I created a full professional communications plan based off my professional expertise in the field, which I have replicated for other refi and regen orgs across the world for free to give them a corporate-level advantage.
 
 Considering the immense depth, breadth and diversity of people who participated in bringing Bloom Network into reality, we worked really hard to create a design system and materials that have non-partisan, earth-based, friendly and bright tones in an effort to convey Earth‚Äôs voice if it could speak, one that works towards the equity and wellbeing of all peoples and beings in our biosphere.
 
 # Impact On Local Communities And Bioregions
 
 I have for 15 years helped manage the intake and training of new local Bloom hubs, managing the communications and screening as well as designing screening processes that help ensure Bloom organizers are aligned with the unity of our vision and purpose in regenerative culture values.
 
 I help manage the administration of our organizer lists and local Bloom hub listings, making sure that only those who want to stay in the community get communicated to and with and ensuring those who want to stay connected are a part of it all.
 
 I am the creator of our program in design process now called Local Love, which splits the incorrectly politicized climate change narrative into digestible, local-focused efforts based on a) local food systems transformation (Local Love) and b) local anti-pollution and anti-corruption efforts (Poison Planet).
 
 I‚Äôm so grateful to be a part of this grant round and thank you so much for taking the time to read about how much love and devotion has gone into the Bloom network, from Magenta and Dani, from myself and from hundreds of beautiful Earth lovers working in these regen spaces over the last couple decades. We love you!",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/16/33

Elgon region, deforestation and landslides have killed over 1,000 people in the last 10 years, devastated crops, and left families starving. Entire communities are at risk of disappearing. Without urgent help, more lives will be lost, and the land will never recover.
 
 In this area, over 95% of the people depend on rain-fed agriculture, and farmers have long believed that trees are space-hungry competitors to their crops, and therefore cut down the trees to allow their crops to grow, leading to deforestation & unsustainable agricultural practices and causing serious biodiversity loss, soil degradation, landslides, and changes in the micro-climate.
 
 Bees and Trees Uganda, a youth-led social enterprise that motivates small-holder farmers to restore their degraded land through beekeeping, planting of indigenous trees and coffee growing, incentivizes these smallholder farmers to reintegrate trees on their farms using agroforestry principles, and giving the farmers beehives, coffee seedlings & indigenous trees at no cost. We also plant fruits that contribute to food security and nutrition in the community.
 
 The incentives for farmers are compelling; the flowers from the trees we plant nourish the bees, the bees generate honey and coffee that they sell to get additional revenue, a safety net during crop failure periods.
 
 Our work contributes to mitigation of the rampant climate related disasters in this region like landslides and soil erosion. The reintroduction of trees leads to landscape restoration, fortifies on-farm biodiversity and improves soil fertility. The bees, nature‚Äôs tireless workers, contribute to food production and ecological balance
 Bees and Trees Uganda has up to date given 120 modern beehives and 2000 coffee seedlings to the farmers. We have further planted 10,000 indigenous trees with the smallholder farmers. 
 
 However, Bees and Trees is a young organization that is still struggling to get funding to scale up our work. We are therefore seeking funding for our ambitious plan by November 2025 is to impact as many more families as possible. This includes;
 
 1. To restore more 25 acres of land by planting 5,000 trees with the smallholder farmers in Bushika Sub-county, one of the most affected areas. This will increase land productivity by 50%
 
 2. To provide more 300 beehives to the farmers. Beekeeping will increase farmer income by 50% by November 2025.
 
 3. To provide 100,000 coffee seedlings to smallholder farmers by November 2025 this will enhance their incomes by 200% by November 2025
 
 4. To increase awareness of 1000 households on sustainable land management by November 2025, which will reduce soil erosion by 70%.
 
 5. Support a women‚Äôs group to establish a coffee and tree nursery to enhance their income opportunities. We will procure tree and coffee seedlings from the women‚Äôs group, thereby fostering economic independence. Additionally, they will have the opportunity to market their products to other community members, further strengthening their financial stability.
 
 All this will increase on-farm biodiversity and re-green the landscape, mitigating landslides by 30% by 2030. This approach aligns with the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration as well as several SDGs.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/643/34

 This has the following impact on Prysm nodes:
 * fast connection establishment (the libp2p handshake completes in 2 RTTs instead of 4-5 RTTs when using TCP)
 * enhanced congestion control and loss recovery -> faster transfer / message propagation speeds (especially on lossy connections)

Foundry is great speed-wise but writing tests in Solidity is a disaster and the command-line interface is bad for complex operations. Hardhat is slow, has way too much boilerplate, interacts poorly with modern ESM. Both projects are very ""do it our way"". The result is that many contracts don't have tests, and the tests that exist aren't end-to-end. 
 
 OTOH, blocksmith.js is simple. It gives you a lightweight wrapper around `forge` and `anvil`, so you can script Foundry however you want. You can use any async JS testing framework, including the default nodejs test runner, or just write simple JS scripts that glue anything you want together. 
 
 To properly test an ENS contract with CCIP-Read, you need to deploy a lot of infrastructure: a registry, a resolver, some names, a CCIP-server, and then test all of the interactions. blocksmith.js makes this trivial.
 
 At the moment, you can `npm i @adraffy/blocksmith`. I'd like to write tests for more contracts to illustrate how to use blocksmith. This is also an useful learning experience as I get to figure out what features I'm missing or what needs improved. This should expand the feature set and improve ergonomics.

 ## Introduction
 Hola! I‚Äôm **DaniBelle**, a **feminine leadership visionary** and **impact activist** focused on bridging technology and nature to create resilient communities and ecosystems. My journey began with a 20-year corporate career in tech networking, but in 2013, I made a shift to something deeply aligned with my heart‚Äî**leading bioregional village-building** efforts through [Bloom Network](https://bloomnetwork.earth/diamante) in Cascadia. I immersed myself in the **land-back movement**, working alongside **Indigenous leaders** and connecting with the back-to-the-land movement. This led me to relocate efforts to Costa Rica, where I saw the greatest potential for **impact through blending traditional wisdom with advanced tools**.
 
 In 2018, I returned to technology through [Giveth](https://giveth.io/) to research and test blockchain tools that could **solve economic challenges**. Engaging with the **Ethereum ecosystem** by attending conferences, building relationships, and gathering skills, I was able to bring these **Web3 cryptophilanthropy tools** and resources back to the communities I serve. Since then, I‚Äôve co-founded and led initiatives like the [Diamante Bridge Collective (DBC)](http://diamantebridge.org/) and [ReFi Costa Rica](https://www.refidao.com/community/local-/refi-costa-rica/r/rechcJzZUiAbvk3tI), continuing to **build bridges** between digital and natural systems, creating pathways for collaboration, resilience, and joy in our communities.
 
 ## Regenerative R&D
 In my work, I seek, test, and share tools that uplift communities, empowering them to **care for the Earth** and **thrive economically** in regenerative ways.
 - **Giveth DAO**: In 2018, I became an early pioneer in **crypto-philanthropy**, co-creating a platform that enables transparent giving to grassroots projects. I onboarded community projects and helped design **decentralized governance systems**, ensuring shared power and fostering a sense of **collective responsibility**. 
 - **Ecosystem Integration**: My entry into the **Ethereum ecosystem** allowed me to engage with the birth of initiatives like [GitCoin](#), **GreenPill**, [Celo](#), and [ReFi DAO](#). By sharing my learnings with **land-based projects**, I helped build **feedback loops** between ground-level organizers and tech builders, increasing adoption and refining these tools for real-world impact. 
 - **ReFi Costa Rica**: In 2023, I launched [ReFi Costa Rica](#) to create a space for **cultural exchanges** between urban and rural communities, empowering them to connect deeply with their lands and one another while laying the groundwork for **regenerative finance** systems to take root.
 
 ## Education and Growth
 To me, education is not just about sharing knowledge but about creating spaces where people feel **empowered to lead** and **connected to their place**.
 - **Diamante Bridge Collective (DBC)**: When I co-founded the [DBC](https://giveth.io/project/Diamante-Bridge-Collective-0) in 2020, it was not just about creating another organization‚Äîit was about creating a **community space** where people could learn, connect, and develop **new ways of being in relationship with the land**. The DBC now operates as **Bloom Diamante**, a local hub offering forums and workshops on **decentralized governance** and **regenerative economies**, grounded in shared wisdom and mutual care. 
 - **ReFi Costa Rica**: Evolving from the DBC, ReFi CR connects communities with **Web3 tools** to regenerate their lands and **share knowledge globally**. By partnering with other orgs across the country, we aim to cultivate **local leaders** and provide them with the education, community support, and economic opportunities they need to thrive. 
 - **Bloom Network**: Since cofounding [Bloom Network](https://bloomnetwork.earth/home) in 2015, I have focused on creating a global community where **regenerative leaders can flourish**‚Äîespecially those whose work has been historically undervalued. Bloom now connects over 40 cities worldwide, offering impact organizers the **resources and tools** to heal their environments and uplift their communities.
 
 ## Operational Support
 My leadership style centers around **creating harmony and balance**, ensuring that the systems we build support people and the planet equally.
 - **Giveth DAO**: In building the operational structures for Giveth.io, I focused on creating **inclusive and collaborative processes** that make it easy for new contributors to **step into leadership roles**. The decentralized governance models I developed allow for **shared leadership** and distribute power, nurturing the collective voice. 
 - **Bloom Network**: I established operational frameworks for [Bloom Network](https://bloomnetwork.earth/diamante), leading the **Diamante Bloom chapter** as a model of autonomous yet interconnected organizational operation. This is **feminine leadership in action**‚Äîempowering others while holding space for the **collective good**. 
 - **Diamante Bridge Collective (DBC)**: Within the DBC, I created systems that allow land-based projects to **collaborate and coordinate** across the bioregion. These systems are designed to **amplify local voices** and promote fluid, adaptable ways of working, so that the people caring for the land are heard and respected.
 
 ## Impact on Local Communities and Bioregions
 At the heart of my work is the belief that **regeneration starts with people**‚Äîcreating deep, meaningful connections between communities and their environments.
 - **ReFi Costa Rica**: My work focuses on **facilitating cultural exchanges** and educational opportunities to help communities collaboratively adopt **regenerative finance systems**. Together, we are restoring land, rights, and livelihoods in Costa Rica. 
 - **Diamante Luz Earth Trust**: Through the [DBC](https://giveth.io/project/diamante-luz-center-for-regenerative-living-0), we‚Äôve established the **Diamante Luz Earth Trust** to allow communities in Costa Rica to manage their lands in a **sustainable and regenerative way**. This initiative is rooted in shared governance, reflecting my commitment to ensuring **local voices lead** the regeneration of their ecosystems. 
 - **Bloom Network**: I have actively supported populating the platform with people and projects that demonstrate replicable practices and **empowered grassroots leaders** to take ownership of their communities‚Äô futures. By providing resources and access to funding, Bloom supports local leaders in creating **positive change** worldwide.
 
 ## Conclusion
 I believe that true regeneration happens when we **nurture both people and the planet**‚Äîwhen we create systems that are not just efficient, but caring. I now advise organizations like [Kinship Earth](https://www.kinshipearth.org/) and [SoilDAO](https://www.soildao.io/), helping them transition to **life-affirming business models**. As I prepare for the [Earth One Global Assembly at Sea](https://earthone.world/gatherings/atlantic-crossing), I‚Äôm committed to continuing this journey of connection and regeneration. Together, we can create a future where **local ecological leadership** and **global technological innovation** come together to restore the world we share.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/16/35
GG22,GG22 OSS - dApps and Apps,"C‚ÄìATTS, Composite Attestations",0xdC81d807F0e1A638DDd5CBF37f1320D86D0dE30C,https://twitter.com/c_atts,https://github.com/c-atts,"C‚ÄìATTS, Composite Attestations",https://catts.run,APPROVED,"Composite attestations are a new type of attestation combining data from multiple sources to form a unified and verifiable credential.
 
 The [Ethereum Attestation Service](https://attest.org) (EAS) is an infrastructure public good for making attestations onchain or offchain about anything. Attestations can represent identity, reputation, knowledge, and much more. EAS is a tokenless and free service that is available on mainnet, several L2s, and various testnets. EAS is a great service! It is tokenless and free for anyone to use. This means it is being used. A lot!
 
 There is a universe of attestation data out there. EAS provides an API that allows you to query that data which makes integration into websites and apps easy.
 
 Let‚Äôs say I, as an app, want to offer membership to users that meet certain criteria. I my backend, I can use the EAS API to query all attestations that are relevant to my use case. Then, I write some custom logic to process the data and let the outcome of that logic determine if a user is eligible for membership. Easy!
 
 But, what if I need to show a proof of the outcome of my logic? What if I need to create an attestation that says ‚ÄúThis user is eligible for membership‚Äù? I can of course easily create that attestation. But, without knowledge of the data I processed or about the processing logic I ran on the data, how can anyone verify that the attestation I created is correct?
 
 Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if there was a way to create attestations based on the result of custom queries and processing logic and have the result of that logic be independently verifiable? That‚Äôs where **C‚ÄìATTS**, the Composite Attestations Engine comes in.
 
 CATTS allows for the creation of **composite attestations** based on custom queries and processing logic. Running on the Internet Computer (ICP) as a smart contract canister, it leverages data from existing attestations via the EAS GraphQL API, ensuring that the creation and verification of attestations are both reliable and transparent. The processing logic is defined as a piece of arbitrary JavaScript code, which is executed securely within the canister environment. The engine also provides a receipt for each run, detailing the settings used, which aids in verifying the correctness of the composite attestations.
 
 ## Planned features
 - Custom queries: Fetch data from the EAS GraphQL API using custom queries.
 - Custom processing logic: Define custom processing logic to create composite attestations based on the result of the queries.
 - Secure execution: The processing logic is executed securely within the canister environment.
 - Receipts: A receipt is created for each run, detailing the settings used, which aids in verifying the correctness of the composite attestations.
 - Chain agnostic: Run queries on one chain or on multiple chains.
 - Verifiable: The result of the processing logic is independently verifiable.
 - Open: The engine is open source and free to use. Anyone can create and run recipes.
 - Cost effective: Attestation runs can be simulated before they are run. This ensures that the cost of running the canister is minimized.
 
 ## Future features
 - Advanced settings:
  - Allow query chain settings to be overridden on a per run and per query basis.
  - Allow users to ‚Äúclaim‚Äù their composite attestations:
 - Transfers cost of creating attestations to the user.
  - Allow the user to claim an attestation using multiple addresses.
 - Even more chain agnostic:
  - Allow the creation of attestations on multiple chains.
  - Allow querying other attestation services, not just EAS.
 - ZK attestations:
  - Allow the creation of zero knowledge attestations.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/608/36

 ## Background and Motivation
 
 I began my journey in the climate space in 2017, documenting frontline indigenous earth guardians through virtual reality (VR) storytelling. My work focused on [sharing the story](https://youtu.be/GJE5QNC4DFc?si=UFBGZqemwgUODOKk) of an indigenous militia protecting their land from illegal logging and poaching in the Brazilian Amazon. This project culminated in presenting the documentary at COP 23 to policymakers. However, witnessing their disengaged response, I realized that simply shifting the worldview of policymakers was insufficient to effect meaningful change. This revelation led me to pursue a deeper understanding of systems change, specifically how we can address the systemic drivers of climate change and ecocide.
 
 My exploration into systems thinking and governance eventually brought me into web3. I recognized the potential of web3 to create the new kinds of infrastructure, incentives, and institutions needed to address resource extraction and ecological collapse at their root causes. Over time, I shifted my focus from filmmaking to studying governance and human coordination, founding [**OpenCivics**](http://www.opencivics.co/) as a decentralized network of innovators developing upstream solutions to these global challenges.
 
 ## Areas of Expertise
 
 - **Systems Change and Governance:** With a background in storytelling, systems thinking, and decentralized governance, my focus is on addressing the human coordination problems underlying ecological destruction and climate change. I believe governance is a crucial tool for re-imagining human interaction with natural systems.
 - **Web3 and Commons Governance:** My deep involvement in web3 has allowed me to explore the potential of decentralized networks to govern the commons. I design governance and coordination models to enable coordination among diverse actors for regenerative action.
 - **Bioregional Governance:** I have a deep passion for bioregional governance as a framework for regenerating ecologies and economies. I support bioregional organizations by helping them navigate web3 tools and governance, and by collaborating on creating decentralized, closed-loop systems.
 
 ## Key Projects and Initiatives
 
 - **Planetary Regeneration Alliance:** Alongside my co-founder, Patricia Parkinson, I co-facilitated a process with nine international regeneration organizations. Together, we developed a pattern language for foundational interventions for bioregions to address in order to create closed-loop economies and parallel systems. This work has helped forge lasting relationships with bioregional organizations, and we are now co-creating a collaborative space for bioregional actors to collectively solve shared design challenges.
 - **Bioregional Builders Network:** Through this initiative, I am working with builders, developers, and community organizers to coordinate at a bioregional scale. The goal is to build infrastructure that empowers bioregions to regenerate ecosystems, create circular economies, and support commons governance.
 - **BioFi Pathfinders Grant Round:** I am currently helping to coordinate the BioFi Pathfinders grant round, which is onboarding bioregional partners into web3, providing them access to web3 grants, and using the round to facilitate coordination among bioregional organizing teams. This initiative is a critical step toward empowering grassroots movements with the tools and resources of web3 to regenerate their bioregions.
 - **Green Pill Podcast (Guest Season Host):** To further amplify the intersection of bioregionalism and web3, I am hosting a guest season on the Green Pill podcast alongside Todd Youngblood. This season will focus on the synergies between bioregional organizing and the decentralized tools available within the web3 space, aiming to inspire further collaboration and innovation.
 
 ## Vision for Regen Citizens Retro Funding
 
 My work is deeply rooted in the vision of empowering grassroots movements, especially bioregional ones, by integrating them with the decentralized tools of web3. I believe that bioregional governance offers a pathway toward building parallel systems that can regenerate ecosystems and foster resilient communities. Through my experience facilitating multi-stakeholder collaborations, designing decentralized governance structures, and educating grassroots organizers, I am committed to creating long-term, scalable solutions that honor both people and planet.
 
 The Regen Citizens Retro Funding Round presents an opportunity to further these efforts. With support from this round, I will continue to build bridges between web3 and bioregional organizations, enabling regenerative economies to flourish and supporting the communities that are already doing the critical work of stewarding our communities, commons, and planet. My goal is to ensure that these grassroots movements have the tools, resources, and governance frameworks necessary to lead the transition toward a regenerative future.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/16/36

 We‚Äôve been holding Neighbourhood Kinship Dialogues to understand how people experience this place so that we can reconcile their dreams with the place‚Äôs potential. Today we are convening the neighbourhood living in semi-permanent structures in the wetland. It‚Äôs Kato‚Äôs turn, he picks up a red pepper and starts telling his story of how sour the hardest day of his life was in this place. 
 
 ‚ÄúWhen someone touches this red pepper, he becomes uneasy. When I came to this place in 2020 from somewhere and started living in that house, the flood water did not treat me well. On Christmas Eve, I bought meat for Christmas celebrations. But it rained and flooded in the house and the floods took my meat when I am seeing. You might laugh but I have witnesses. Spaghetti went when am seeing, even ducks came when they were dead, because of that stream. I felt anger because I did not eat the meat yet I bought it when I wanted it. So in 2020, I was mistreated but even to date am still mistreated.‚Äù 
 
 Kato‚Äôs story above is one of many stories that define a development paradigm misaligned with the essence and potential of a place.
 
 THE STORY OF KAMPALA.
 Kampala‚Äôs name stems from a deep kinship between its hills, wetlands, impalas, and humans. Formed over 65 million years ago by tectonic forces, the hills were grazed and wetlands drank by impalas for millions of years. Humans, recognizing this bond, named the area ""Kasozi ka Impala"" (hill of Impalas), which later evolved into Kampala. This name reflects a harmonious relation between humans, nature, and land that existed for ages.
 
 However, in the 1800s, colonial interventions disrupted this harmony, relocating Impalas, and speculative fragmentation of land leading to social fragmentation and urban sprawling leading to ecosystem destruction. This systemic misalignment is manifested in Kato‚Äôs story. From self to system, the 1800s marked a growing disconnection between humans and their natural and cultural essence and from the land and ecosystems.
 
 In 2020, an effort to revive this connection was sparked when Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) and Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) installed sculptures of Impalas and other wildlife along the city‚Äôs streets. Commendable as these symbolic efforts maybe, they are working below human potential.
 
 A more collective effort, can recreate the habitat for not only the return of the Impala and other indicator species, but also the return of our human nature, but most importantly, the return of the precolonial harmonious relation between humans, nature, and the land.
 Nalubaaga wetland starts its +80-mile flow into the Nile from Kiwatule, Kampala. Greater Kampala isn‚Äôt just home to 4+ million people, but also its many hills and valleys source 30+ wetlands and biodiversity facing extinction. It‚Äôs thus a critical region for food security, climate adaptation, housing, education, healthcare, biodiversity ‚Äì hence the need for systems transformation.
 We aim to shift public opinion on landuse from speculative extraction to stewardship, inspiring landowners to collaborate towards a land commons infrastructure that nurtures the natural, social, cultural, and economic health of Nalubaaga-2030. Regenerative landuse increases productivity, enabling urban livelihoods to evolve in harmony with natural ecosystems.
 This is an ambitious project, but we are taking baby steps ‚Äî we‚Äôll run seven community transformation experiments that progressively build up to a regenerative, commons-enhanced relational local economy by 2030. Below is the first relational experiment.
 
 EXPERIMENT ONE: 
 Improving the Human ‚áã Wetland ‚áã Waste ‚áã Land ‚áã Biodiversity Relation in Nalubaaga wetland
 
 Task
 To transform the degraded relations between humans, wetland, waste, and biodiversity in the Nalubaaga. Currently, the urban part of this 80-mile wetland system is choked with urban waste, threatening both human and ecological health. Yet within this crisis lies the opportunity to rebuild a regenerative relation where waste becomes a resource, community ties strengthen, and both people and nature thrive.
 
 PURPOSE
 This experiment aims to demonstrate how urban communities can transform environmental challenges into opportunities for regeneration. By reconnecting people with their wetland, we create a model where:
 
 1) Ecological Health: A restored Nalubaaga wetland/stream system provides clean water, flood protection, native medicine, and habitat for biodiversity.
 
 2) Social Wellbeing: Communities shift from seeing Nalubaaga as a dump site to valuing her as a living entity contributing to the vitality & viability of this place. 
 
 3) Economic Vitality: Waste transforms from a problem into an economic opportunity, creating local jobs, and enhancing incomes and livelihoods.
 
 4) Cultural Renewal: Traditional knowledge and modern practices combine for holistic regeneration.
 
 5) Future Restoration Process: we are essentialy prototyping a process for other urban ecosystems facing similar challenges to adopt and adapt to their context.
 
 PRODUCTS
 The project will deliver tangible outcomes that demonstrate regeneration in action:

 1) A restored wetland with flourishing waterways and biodiversity
 
 2) Small-scale waste processing facilities turning waste into valuable resources
 
 3) Commoned land serving both ecosystem and neighbourhood needs.
 
 Activated Social Systems:
 1) Active community networks coordinated around ecosystem care
 
 2) A working alternative currency system rewarding regenerative actions
 
 3) Documented traditional knowledge informing modern conservation.
 
 Economic Engines:
 1) Local enterprises built on wetland regeneration
 Job opportunities in waste transformation and ecological restoration
 
 2) Innovation center supporting ongoing regenerative development
 
 Legal Frameworks:
 1) Personhood status for Nalubaaga wetland
 
 2)Community-led governance infrastructure
 
 3) Baseline common guidelines for relating with Nalubaaga Wetland.
 
 
 PROCESS
 Phase 1: Foundation Building (Months 1-3)
 
 1) Neighborhood Kinship Dialogues (these are going on now) to build a shared vision - community gatherings are held convening residents to generate collective will to co-create a regenerative future for their place come 2030.
 
 2) Begin wisdom-gathering sessions: Elders share stories of interdependence with ecosystems and collective care, these are shared on the WhatsApp community channel.
 
 3) Land Acquisition Preparation: Careful review of who owns which pieces of land, followed by respectful conversations with landowners about the vision for renewal. Legal teams work to ensure all agreements serve the landowner, community and Nalubaaga‚Äôs needs.
 
 Phase 2: Recommoning Land (Months 1-2)
 
 1) Register Nalubaaga Valley Community (NVC): Draft bylaws on regenerative principles and register a collectively governed cooperative with a controlling stake for Nalubaaga wetland. Recommoned land will be collectively stewarded via NVC and ventures run with residents.
 
 2) Draft Land Recommoning Process & Agreements: although some will prefer their land be bought outright, the first priority is inspiring them to stay here and benefit from contributing their land to the vision of renewal of this place, come 2030.
 
 3) Quadratic Funding for Stewardship: enabling landowners to vote on which community initiatives‚Äîreceive how much funding. This process trains the stewardship muscle of landowners micro-dosing them towards becoming landstewards shaping the wetland's future.
 
 4) Start priority land acquisitions: Securing key pieces of land where waste processing facilities and native species sanctuary can be established. Priority acquisitions on high risk biodiversity loss, high impact areas - like spots where waste currently enters the wetland or where birds still nest. This land becomes a place of renewal, where nature starts healing itself, healing our human nature, culture and human activity.
 
 5) Hold land recommoning ceremonies: As land enters the collective stewardship realm, ceremonies will be organized welcoming her (the land) return into commons. These rituals strengthen the resident‚Äôs bond with the wetland, their place while initiating and inspiring the process and journey where 70-80% of land is recommoned and collectively stewarded.
 
 Phase 3: Infrastructure Development (Months 2-3)
 1) Feasibility Survey: carryout a short study on the feasibility of establishing small scale waste processing and wetland innovation center here and aacquire licences.
 
 2) Construct waste processing facilities: Building simple but effective waste sorting and processing facilities ‚Äì community composting for urban gardening, plastic recycling and upcycling, and water protection systems, all designed to be operated by resident team.
 
 3) Nalubaaga Innovation Center: Convert a school that closed due to COVID into a skilling and business incubation centre, developing waste and wetland products and services into regenerative enterprises run by residents supporting them to start small enterprises that support wetland health while creating income.
 
 Phase 4: Program Implementation (Months 3-7)
 
 1) Massive Cleanup & Wetland Restoration: organise a mass cleanup event carefully ridding the urban part of Nalubaaga of the harmful waste and pollutants that is choking her. Remove invasive plants, followed by replanting of native species. Local knowledge guides which plants go where, recreating the natural water filtration system that once existed.
 
 2) Launch Waste-to-Value exchange system: Introduce ""Nalubaaga Credits"" where residents receive tokens for bringing sorted waste to processing centers. Credits can be used at local shops or exchanged for needed services, making waste valuable instead of menace.
 
 3) Start Rewilding Days: Regular community days where families help plant native species and create wildlife habitats. School Children learn to identify birds, insects, and other wildlife, returning to the area while also improving the aesthetic and ecological value of the wetland, as elders share knowledge of each plant, or other species‚Äô purpose and care.
 
 Ongoing Activities
 
 1) Regular Cleanup Events: Bi-weekly community cleanup days become social events, where work is followed by shared meals and storytelling, building stronger neighborhood bonds while steadily improving the environment.
 
 2)Ecological Monitoring: Simple but regular checks of water quality, returning wildlife, and plant health by trained community members. Results are shared through WhatsApp groups and community boards for everyone see the impact of their work.
 
 3) Regeneration Planning: Monthly meetings where community leaders review progress, adjust plans, and ensure activities remain aligned with community needs and environmental health. Each session builds on lessons learned and celebrates successes while planning next steps.
 
 4) Nalubaaga Regeneration Financial System: Co-Design and promote Obuntu Credits and community efforts flow back into regenerative projects. This cycle creates a system where both land and community continuously flourish, ensuring the wetland‚Äôs restoration.
 
 5) Totem-Based Human Coordinating: reawaken our totemic system, redirecting its spiritual-coordination power from uniting us by blood relations to uniting us for place thriving by innovating totemic roles around ecological essence of plants, animals, and other entities.
 
 CAPABILITIES NEEDED
 The project requires a blend of skills and knowledge across multiple domains:
 
 Traditional Knowledge:
 Deep understanding of local ecological systems, traditional conservation practices, and cultural values that have historically maintained wetland health.
 
 Technical Expertise:
 Modern waste management techniques, ecological restoration methods, and GIS monitoring systems that can track progress and impact.
 
 Social Skills:
 Community organizing, conflict resolution, and facilitation abilities to maintain community engagement and resolve competing interests.
 
 Management Capacity:
 Project planning, financial oversight, legal advisory, partnership management, and systems thinking to ensure all elements work together effectively.
 
 Innovation Abilities:
 Business development, social enterprise creation, and alternative currency management to build regenerative economies.
 
 WHY SUPPORT NOW?
 Each dollar catalyzes lasting transformation: 
 $10 provides cleanup tools for a family, 
 $25 could support a week of youth training, 
 $50 could help establish a community composting station.
 
 Join us in transforming waste into wealth, pollution into possibility, and despair into hope.
 
 Together, we can restore Nalubaaga's legacy for future generations.

 There‚Äôs a reason why ancient cultures thrived in harmony with the Earth for millennia‚Äîthey understood the balance between science and spirituality. If we truly want to regenerate the Earth, we can‚Äôt view climate tech in isolation from the spiritual connection we have with nature. Modern research even shows that [water has memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_memory), and [trees can communicate both above and below ground](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-whispering-trees-180968084/#:~:text=Trees%20share%20water%20and%20nutrients,Scientists%20call%20these%20mycorrhizal%20networks.)‚Äîinsights that Indigenous cultures have always known.
 
 Look at the past 50 years: 75% of the world‚Äôs wildlife has vanished, billions of hectares have been deforested, and water systems across the globe have been poisoned by PFAS and countless man-made chemicals. **What if we saw this devastation as more than just a resource crisis?** These beings - water, plants, creatures - are the conscious fibers of Gaia, our living planet.
 
 **We can‚Äôt fix the damage with the same consciousness that caused it**‚Äîseparation, colonization, exploitation. We need to acknowledge the sacredness and interconnectedness of all life, and our role not as conquerors or consumers, but as guardians of Earth‚Äôs consciousness.
 
 As we explore decentralized solutions through web3, **we must embrace our sacred role as regenerators, storytellers, and awakened shamans**. Decentralization and web3 hold a sacred purpose‚Äîa mirror of the Matrix (divine feminine), where free will and self-determination guide humanity‚Äôs future. **Just as ecosystems thrive through balance, so must human society**. It is in this spirit that I create *Artisans of Time*, *Gaia‚Äôs Awakening*, and other stories that depict utopian futures where technology and spirituality harmonize to heal and sustain the Earth.
 
 ## The Story of Artisans of Time and My Journey
 
 *Artisans of Time* is more than just a sci-fi story‚Äîit's a vision of a regenerative future where the free will of women, technology, and nature coexist. In this story, Emma, a hardware artist, fights for recognition in a world where technological innovation is restricted to the elite. Her journey represents the real-life challenges women face today in STEM fields, and her story is one of resilience, creativity, and liberation.
 
 My entire journey has led to this moment:
 
 - **1980s/90s:** Grew up on a regenerative farm, planting 100,000 trees and learning how to live sustainably.
 - **1990s:** Attended law school, with a focus on human rights.
 - **2000s:** Led a national project for youth engagement in democracy, winning a UN Youth Summit Award. Co-created a trust metric patent (early swarm technology) and built homeschool communities focused on organic gardening and conscious parenting.
 - **2010s:** Connected to Gaia to relearn primal birthing techniques so that women can birth again in less than one hour, founded Surf Coast Natural School which attracted 700 families, [Outdoor School Article](https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/students-can-sit-in-a-forest-on-their-ipad-outdoor-school-plan-grows-roots-20170123-gtx3id.html), and launched Miss Blockchain tech magazine to support women in web3. I also co-founded WiBi (Women in Blockchain International) which lives on today as a Telegram group. Interviewed 40+ global birthkeepers to preserve ancient and indigenous birthing wisdom, representing 10,000s of births and thousands of years as birth keepers. [Watch Interviews](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_YZ62Q50ngsHrM8iOKrDMw).
 - **2020s:** Launched Drivyx to empower regenerative projects in web3 and began assisting Gitcoin grantees from Oceania and beyond. Founded Womyn in GG, a Telegram group to support women-led projects in Gitcoin rounds. Supported Lets Grow DAO live Twitter spaces, and led ""How to Market Your Grant"" resources for GG22. [Read Resource](https://paragraph.xyz/editor/sUwZyGiFdx3c6qOrJEYm).
 - **Scriptwriting:** Authored three plus utopian sci-fi scripts, including *Artisans of Time*, which envisions a future where technology and nature are in harmony. [My Coverfly Profile](https://writers.coverfly.com/profile/akasha).

 ## Why Your Support Matters
 
 Supporting *Artisans of Time* in this Gitcoin round means backing a project that connects human rights, biodiversity, and sustainability in a way that few do. I‚Äôve spent 30 years fighting for these values in different sectors, from regenerative farming to inclusion in emerging technology, and now I‚Äôm bringing that experience to storytelling and web3.
 
 But *Artisans of Time* is more than just a film‚Äîit‚Äôs the start of something bigger. With my background in web3 game marketing and development, my vision is to expand this story into an immersive world where people can engage, create, and make an impact.
 
 ![Image](https://hackernoon.imgix.net/images/zq4kRoY1koM2G9ICsR601fXkYy22-5de33iv.jpeg)
 
 Imagine a game where players are rewarded for taking real-world positive environmental actions and can interact with their own regenerative AI chatbot coach. But it doesn't stop there‚Äî*Artisans of Time* could also include AR/VR elements, where you look at your current city and imagine it transformed into the utopian world of *Artisans of Time*, filled with trees, plants, and clean energy solutions.
 
 *Artisans of Time* lends itself perfectly to game development and immersive storytelling. It‚Äôs a world where the audience doesn‚Äôt just watch the story unfold‚Äîthey participate in shaping the narrative and envision a regenerative future.

My journey has taken me across borders, languages, and diverse communities, but my mission remains the same: to empower others with the tools, knowledge, and opportunities needed to engage in building a more regenerative world.
 
 My work revolves around creating spaces and platforms that support ReFi, through podcasts, workshops, and partnerships, I‚Äôm committed to helping people understand what ReFi can do and how they can be part of it‚Äîwhether through education, collaboration, or direct action.
 
 Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôve contributed to the regenerative finance ecosystem and the ReFi DAO community:
 
 - ReFi DAO & Partnerships: As Head of Partnerships for ReFi DAO, I spent 2023 connecting key players in the space. From forming partnerships with CELO, ICP, and Polygon to building bridges across ecosystems, my focus was on strengthening the regenerative movement by bringing people and projects together.
 
 - Planta-R Podcast: I host Planta-R, a podcast in Portuguese that gives voice to ReFi projects across the Lusophone world‚ÄîBrazil, Angola, Mozambique, Portugal, and beyond. With nine episodes live and a second season on the way, I‚Äôm working to create a space where Portuguese-speaking communities can connect with the global ReFi movement and contribute to its growth.
 
 - ReFi Node Lisboa: As co-founder of the first ReFi Node in Lisbon, I‚Äôm helping to build a local ReFi ecosystem through community events, educational programs, and workshops. From hosting sessions for immigrants and refugees to explore blockchain and employment opportunities, to supporting new ReFi projects in Portugal, we‚Äôre laying the groundwork for a more inclusive and regenerative economy.
 
 - Mentorship & Hackathons: I‚Äôm committed to mentoring the next generation of builders through workshops at universities and events like the NOVA hackathons, where I guide students and innovators in exploring blockchain‚Äôs potential for regenerative finance.
 
 - Positive Blockchain: In 2018, I co-founded Positive Blockchain, which has grown into one of the largest databases for impact-driven blockchain projects. This platform connects people who are eager to make a difference through blockchain, and has inspired blockchain-for-impact events in cities like Berlin.
 
 At the heart of my work is a deep belief that regenerative finance can create real change‚Äîboth in the way we structure our economies and in how we uplift and care for our communities and the planet.
 
 My key goals are:
 
 - Expanding Knowledge and Accessibility: Through platforms like Planta-R and my workshops, I aim to make ReFi more accessible, especially to communities who might not traditionally have access to Web3 tools, with a focus on Portuguese-speaking regions.
 
 - Empowering Local Communities & Projects: My work with ReFi Lisboa focuses on educating and equipping local communities ‚Äîparticularly marginalized groups, such as immigrants and refugees in Lisbon‚Äîso they can engage in ReFi for both personal and collective growth.
 
 - Supporting the Global ReFi Movement: From leading the global ReFi toolkit update to writing the 2024 ReFi DAO nodes round-up and representing ReFi at events like ETH Prague, I strive to ensure that local grassroots efforts are connected to the global regenerative movement.
 
 I believe that regeneration starts with community, and that‚Äôs what drives my work‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs building partnerships across the ReFi space, mentoring the next generation, or simply creating platforms for people to share their stories and ideas. I‚Äôve been fortunate to help spread the message of ReFi in Lisbon, Berlin, S√£o Paulo, and beyond, and I‚Äôm always humbled by the incredible people I meet who share the same vision for a better, regenerative future. Together, we‚Äôre making it happen.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/16/38

 $700M was wasted in 2023 on Kickstarter alone when fully funded projects never deliver what was promised. This is because traditional crowdfunding platforms fail to provide guarantees. 
 
 ### The solution
 ![howitworks](https://i.imgur.com/N74nlT5.png)
 viaPrize solves this by taking the funds for a project and then welcoming anyone to complete the project. If no one completes the project, then everyone is refunded. 
 
 Prizes include three types of contributors:
 ![benefitsforusers](https://i.imgur.com/9xmyEhR.png)
 Prize proposers come up with the project idea
 Prize funders elevate the best ideas by showing demand
 Prize contestants win rewards building the project
 
 With viaPrize, ideas are crowdsourced, rewards are crowdfunded, and project execution is an open invitation.
 
 ### The Middle Road for Public Goods Funding
 Prizes open up a complementary alternative in the public goods funding ecosystem that balances funder confidence and builder security. 
 
 Gitcoin optimizes for builder security because it gives upfront funds, but lacks funder confidence because there is no guarantee of success. 
 
 Optimism Retro PGF optimizes for funder confidence because funders review the impact of existing projects and add rewards, but lacks builder security because there is no guarantee of any particular amount of funding.
 
 With prizes, funders know the project will be built or they are refunded, so they have some confidence. Builders know there is a certain amount of funding waiting for them if they successfully create a project, so they have some security. 
 
 ![Balancing](https://i.imgur.com/iLPihrt.png)
 We look forward to a full public goods funding user journey where you receive:
 QF Grant - Before building (and ongoing)
 Crowdfunded Prize - When you finish building (prizes for a whole product and prizes for particular features)
 Retro PGF - When you see the impact of what was built
 
 ### Our origins
 The concept of crowdfunded prizes sounded revolutionary as Noah discussed it with residents of the entrepreneurs' pop-up city Zuzalu, so we tested it. As residents discussed the idea of making an AI voice for a river, Noah launched a prize and residents tossed in $20. After an impromptu five day hackathon attracting twelve builders, we presented the first AI voice for a nature entity in history to the Prime Minister of Montenegro. If we had used Kickstarter, then only the team who posted an idea would receive funds. By using prizes, any builder was welcome.
 ![RiverAITeam](https://imgur.com/tdrnul7.png)
 
 However, Noah wanted to be certain this can make a real impact. Thus, he found himself watching anti-missile defense shoot down a kamikaze drone as it dove towards him while on the way to deliver medical supplies in Ukraine, funded by a prize from viaPrize.org
 The medics ended up using the supplies treating 45 injured and saving multiple lives, and Noah decided to pursue this initiative full time.
 ![myfavoriteprize](https://i.imgur.com/TxlQzz1.png)
 
 ### Traction
 
 As of July, 2024 we have distributed over $50,000 and have successful prizes for building projects ranging from free productivity apps to writing competitions.
 We take a 5% platform fee. 
 
 ### Thank You Gitcoin!
 
 This has all been accomplished with our full time team being supported through our sole funding coming coming from over 2000 donors on Gitcoin plus matching. Thank you for making this possible!
 
 More about that here:
 https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-appreciations-thread/18332
 
 Update: In Sep 2024 we also received a grant from the Optimism foundation! 
 
 ### Traditional Fundraisers
 
 In Jan 2024, we added crowdfunding ""fundraisers"" with two types:
 ""Pass-through"" where funds are immediately directed to the recipient
 ""All-or-nothing"" where you refund everyone if the funding goal is not met by the deadline
 
 ### Next steps
 
 MVP - Tested during Zuzalu
 V1 - Current version. Usable for crypto natives
 V2 - By the end of Jul 2024. Easier onboarding for web2 users.
 V3 - By the end of Sep 2024. Accessibility for people in developing countries by having a mobile app and cash off-ramps around the world for those who do not have bank accounts.
 
 We are incubating the project by living with users and iterating on their feedback during Zuzalu-inspired pop-up villages around the world.

 üîÜ How does it work?
 BrightID is creating a giant pseudonymous social graph of people all around the world. Users can make private, cryptographically secure connections to people they know, using a smartphone app. This pseudonymous connection data is shared among a decentralized group of computer nodes that store and analyze the public social graph. The nodes of the network determine and verify the likely uniqueness of each account, based on its interconnectivity with other accounts. The user can then use their BrightID verification to prove to any integrated system that they have one and only one account. The potential integrations are endless.
 
 
 üîÜ Where will my contributions go?
 BrightID Main DAO is a LAO (a DAO with a legal wrapper) that stewards centralized pieces until they can be decentralized, such as the app registry, website, and app store entries. It also has stewardship over grant and sponsorship income, and functions as a non-profit. It has been committed to BrightID‚Äôs core mission and funded the core team since its inception in Feb 2020.
 100% of contributed funds will go to BMAIN DAO.

After proving the dApp is user-friendly to our non-crypto native audience, we are ready to starting developing into a chain-agnostic platform, making it adaptable to various blockchain ecosystems, enhancing flexibility for local communities.
 
 Upe Impact is a revolutionary web application designed to facilitate the coordination of community betterment projects for non crypto natives. With an integrated authentication system powered by thirdweb, the application generates user wallets upon login, ensuring secure access for all users, regardless of their technical expertise, from web3 natives to novices. This design ensures that any web user can utilize this tool with zero web3 knowledge.
 
 In essence, Upe Impact puts the heart of their communities on the blockchain by providing tools that enhance efficiency in community projects and ensuring that the efforts of volunteers and organizers are accurately recorded, verified, and celebrated.
 Upe Impact is a companion dApp for Upe. In its current state, Upe innovates by putting together, in the same place, the local information, collected and curated by locals, and spaces (like digital Agoras) for the community to make decisions. It‚Äôs an App that we aim to turn into a DApp.
 
 Usually, this kind of initiative comes from governments or big corporations trying to capture local data. Upe is a civic-bottom-up data initiative verified and tested (by communities, individuals, small businesses, tourists, and even the government of Costa Rica), and it already has traction, as our stats show. Our community framework can be forked for any other local community.

 THE PROBLEM
 
 Currently, on web2 media platforms, creators have a lot of problems like privacy, censorship, and more. Especially for web3 content creators, the channels got banned and de-platformed without warning or any justification. Creators should have a platform where they can own their content and have a direct connection with their subscribers or members.
 
 
 SOLUTION
 
 We aimed to develop a decentralized media-sharing app, where content creators own their video content. By storing videos permanently in Arweave and the metadata stored permanently on-chain, no one can restrict users from creating content of their choice. Creators can always monetize their content with various means like nft modules and tips.

 Building coordination tech for climate resilience & regeneration ü§ù
 
 # Introduction to Atlantis
 
 Founded in 2022, Atlantis is a borderless peer to peer impact network.
 We build a range of tools for initiating, implementing and reporting the impact of climate and social projects. Our aim is to make it easier for NGOs, Social Enterprises, Impact DAOs to digitise their impact creation, fundraising & team management.
 
 Our products and services are geared to make existing organizations effective while making it easier for new organizations to bloom.
 
 # Mission 
 
 ## Accelerating Resilience and Regeneration
 
 Our mission is two fold, on one side Resilience, with rising climate shocks we will need to defend our water, food, energy supply lines. Defend them from floods, droughts, wildfires and other climate events. 
 
 On the other side is Regeneration. While we build resilience to mitigate climate change and adapt to it, we also need to actively accelerate removal and reduction of GHG by making regenerative life support systems more accessible.
 
 [![Vision-Mission.png](https://i.postimg.cc/TwvFc7BC/Vision-Mission.png)](https://postimg.cc/Y48dr3rW)
 
 # Vision
 
 We dream of a future where humans finally decouple progress from the current degenerative systems to more regenerative systems. A future where we realize there is no economic wellness without ecological wellness. Like Buckminster Fuller says, what we need is a design revolution, one which will make it possible for Spaceship Earth to work for ALL.

 Check out our recent articles!
 https://ethlimo.substack.com/p/ethlimo-everything-youve-wanted-to
 https://ethlimo.substack.com/p/ethlink-is-now-powered-by-ethlimo
 ‚úÖ eth.limo supports every ENS compatible storage layer! Users can utilize IPFS, Arweave and Swarm contenthashes.
 
 ‚úÖ CCIP-Read for L2 and off-chain lookups are also supported!
 
 ‚úÖEmoji and unicode domains supported! [üòÇüòÇüòÇ.eth.limo](https://xn--g28haa.eth.limo/)
 
 ‚úÖ Limo now supports on-demand @ensdomains subdomain certificates!
 What does this mean? You can now automatically issue a certificate for ENS subdomains without requesting one from us! 
 How does this work? Once you submit an HTTP request for your name (i.e. app.myname.eth. limo), we'll attempt to issue the certificate in the background. Usually this process takes 1-2m and during that time you might need to keep refreshing the page in your browser. Once the certificate has been issued you'll be able to visit your subdomain on eth.limo.
 
 
 ‚úÖ DNS over HTTPS (DoH) Resolver DNS over HTTPS (DoH) resolver. We now offer an easy to use DNS resolver for ENS domains. The DoH resolver can be integrated with applications for native ENS resolution, or even your browser! We feature both JSON and DNS wire format responses with DNSLink support. This means you can configure your local IPFS client to resolve ENS domains directly from us with the following command:
 `ipfs config --json DNS.Resolvers '{""eth."": ""https://dns.eth.limo/dns-query""}'`
 For example if you then requested vitalik.eth, a DNS query would be constructed (https://dns.eth.limo/dns-query?name=vitalik.eth&type=TXT) which would return:
 >dnslink=/ipfs/QmQhCuJqSk9fF58wU58oiaJ1qbZwQ1eQ8mVzNWe7tgLNiD/
 Which would instruct your IPFS client to retrieve the CID above. Consult our documentation for implementation details.
 [Documentation](https://github.com/ethlimo/documentation)
 
 ‚úÖ Chauffeur - Run a local infrastructure stack for resolving ENS domains. https://github.com/ethlimo/chauffeur
 
 ‚úÖHTTP Object Caching - Improving content retrieval times is always a priority for the eth.limo team. After several weeks of careful testing we have fully implemented static content object caching, globally for all eth.limo resolved names. This means that we will cache content retrieved from IPFS and save it for later retrieval. The result being much faster page load times for all static content.
 
 ‚úÖBase32 and Base36 Encoding for IPFS/IPNS - We have updated both the eth.limo gateway and our DNS over HTTPS service to explicitly use Base32 encoding for IPFS CIDs and Base36 for IPNS peer IDs.
 
 ‚úÖLIMO takes public gateway services a step further by enforcing strong privacy guarantees such as never logging IP addresses or engaging in TCP fingerprinting. Limo now actively blocks FLoC (Federated Learning of Cohorts). This is a Google developed algorithm that tracks and correlates users based on their browsing history. FLoC enables advanced fingerprinting capabilities and greatly undermines online privacy and anonymity.

 üéâ2024 Future endeavorsüéâ
 
 We‚Äôre busy working on the following updates & new features:
 ‚ñ™Ô∏èMulti-region CDN deployment (better performance and reliability)
 ‚ñ™Ô∏èENS resolution manager app
 ‚ñ™Ô∏èContinued work on ENS native DNS resolver in anticipation of the .eth TLD being welcomed into the ICANN gTLD namespace (limo-web3-dns)
 ‚ñ™Ô∏èGateway as a Service implementation of the eth.limo API
 ‚ñ™Ô∏èImproved IPv6 support
 ‚ñ™Ô∏èLight client fallback from Alchemy RPC API
 ‚ñ™Ô∏èResearch on HTTP Header Standards for ENS dWebsites
 
 HTTP headers are tricky to get right, even more so in decentralised environments. Certain browser features (like SharedArrayBuffer) can only be used in a ‚ÄúSame-Origin‚Äù context, which requires the use of certain server side headers to be returned to the client. With this in mind, we are investigating the best way for users to define their own header and value pairs at the ENS record level. This would be a new standard for ENS HTTP gateways and permit users to fully leverage all available browser features irrespective of how the content is accessed (i.e. gateway or web3 native browsers).
 
 
 Why do we need ETH.LIMO?
 
 ‚úîÔ∏èCore internet infrastructure is becoming increasingly centralized and as such, several existential threats have emerged that undermine the principles of an decentralized, open and free internet:
 
 ‚úîÔ∏èLack of non-commercial infrastructure
 
 ‚úîÔ∏èOpacity of terms of service agreements and moderation policies
 
 ‚úîÔ∏èProliferation of proprietary browser extensions which require centralized services 
 
 ‚úîÔ∏èThe erosion of the ‚Äúcommons‚Äù and ‚Äúpublic space‚Äù
 
 ‚úîÔ∏èWeb 3.0 adoption is still nascent
 
 ‚úîÔ∏èMost browsers cannot natively access ENS/IPFS
 
 
 For end users, this means a limited selection of poor quality services that increasingly resemble a cable TV package. Accessing the dWeb can be a frustrating experience. For dApp developers, this leads to a limited selection of platforms and services in addition to lost revenue.
 
 The LIMO project brings additional resiliency to dApps by providing an alternative means of access as a public good. As the decentralized web continues to grow, it is imperative that community projects facilitate the transition from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0.
 
 The LIMO project is organized around the following founding principles:
 
 1. Operate ETH.LIMO as a public good.
 
 2. Establish community governance and oversight.
 
 a. Provide support and technical guidance for builders and users.
 
 3. Work towards building a truly decentralized ENS/IPFS gateway service and global CDN.
 
 4. Build a world-class developer platform for dweb sites, including integrated analytics reporting and traffic management deployment tooling for commonly used web2 patterns such as A/B testing, canary and blue/green deployments.
 
 5. A commitment to open source software and the advancement of web3 through education, best practices, evangelism, and public accessibility.

 Block explorers function as the de facto front-end for blockchain data. They provide transparency for transaction, block, address, and contract information, as well as analytical insights into transfers, block times, gas prices, and accounts. They display essential context for additional project data, token information, and related tags.
 
 Block explorers also support blockchain developers through API access, contract verification, and contract interaction tools. For Layer 2s, they serve not only the L2 transaction data but also provide views of the underlying L1 data so that users can get the complete picture as batches travel between layers.
 
 Block explorers are integral infrastructure for a decentralized ecosystem. At Blockscout, we build an open-source explorer that can be used by all EVM chains. Chains are free to fork Blockscout, customize it as they see fit, and use it to support their network. 
 
 # Open-source block explorers are a vital public good
 Just as we need multiple clients for Ethereum, we need multiple explorers and tooling diversity for the Ethereum and rollup ecosystem. If (or when) an explorer is down, others are there to step in and support.
 
 This redundancy is important, but it is not Blockscout's sole mission. Our mission is to provide a first-class, open-source, decentralized explorer for all users‚Äîan explorer built by and for the community that can provide everything users, developers, and projects need to successfully explore and develop on a chain.
 
 Over the past year, we've been working hard on Blockscout. Thanks to community contributions, we've optimized Blockscout for speed while overhauling the front-end for ease of use. We've introduced tools to make smart contract verification much easier and added tagging, account functionality, marketplace features, and more.
 
 With your help, we will continue adding tools and features to support Ethereum and the network of L2s and L3s building on top.
 
 # Open-source explorers support the entire ecosystem
 
 EVM blockchains and L2s including zk rollups and optimistic rollups need open-source explorers and tooling to support: 
 - Freely available data
 - Data accuracy checks
 - Redundancy and resiliency 
 - Community-driven features, customizations and innovations
 - Transparency
 - Quick, cost-effective implementation, especially for testnets
 - Small chain and niche chain support
 - Consistent multi-chain experience
 - Ongoing, fast feature development
 - Trustlessness and auditability
 - Security through malicious contract and address labelling, and security scoring for contracts.
 
 # Blockscout is a community-driven solution

 Blockscout has been in production for more than 6 years. We continue to build and improve an open-source explorer used by 600+ chains in the space including most testnets + a hosted [Ethereum mainnet](https://eth.blockscout.com/) and testnet instances provided as public goods. 
 
 Blockscout is used by all types of chains to quickly spin up an instance and provide transactional transparency right away for their users. We continue to make strides with our interface, indexing speed and optimization, and your help is vital to continued improvements and development.

 Through contributions from previous Gitcoin Grants Round we've been able to fully open-source the Blockscout UI, introduce MyAccount, create the DAppscout marketplace and provide ENS support! 
 
 We are continuing to work on our project roadmap for the remainder of the year to include better AA (account abstraction) and DA (Data Availability) support. We are also working on a multichain explorer environment designed to help tie the diverse ecosystem of L1s, L2s and L3s together.
 
 You can learn more about additional items we are working on (or to make a suggestion or get involved), please see our [Roadmap](https://docs.blockscout.com/about/roadmap) and the [Blockscout Docs](https://docs.blockscout.com).

Extreme droughts, rising temperatures, and years of unsustainable agricultural practices‚Äîlike the overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides‚Äîhave left the soil barren and fragile. In a region where over 65% of agricultural land is degraded, the consequences are severe: food insecurity, declining livelihoods, and conflicts between farmers and herders competing for dwindling resources.
 But there is hope. Earth Guardians' Soil Regeneration for Agriculture & Pastoralism project is bringing the land back to life. By integrating scientific methods with traditional ecological knowledge, we‚Äôre tackling these challenges head-on‚Äîrestoring soil fertility, improving water retention, and helping farmers adopt sustainable practices that support both the environment and the local economy. This project is about more than just soil; it's about rebuilding the foundation of life in Keur Ndiol.

 The Urgency:
 For decades, the region has relied on chemical fertilizers and pesticides to boost short-term yields. However, these methods have stripped the soil of its natural nutrients, polluted water supplies, and led to a cycle of land exhaustion. Coupled with increasingly severe droughts, rising temperatures, and desertification, the land can no longer support the communities that depend on it.
 Farmers and herders find themselves competing for access to shrinking plots of usable land, leading to increased tension and conflict. As the land deteriorates, food production plummets, making it harder for families to survive, let alone thrive.
 This project aims to break that cycle. By replacing harmful practices with regenerative techniques like composting, organic fertilizers, and improved water management, we‚Äôre not only restoring the land but building resilience to climate change. Our work will support healthier soil, more productive farms, and a stronger local economy.

 Project Objectives:
 This project is a part of Earth Guardians‚Äô broader efforts to restore ecosystems and uplift communities in the Sahel through regenerative land management and reforestation. The main objectives of the project include:
 
 * Restoring degraded soil across 100 hectares to enhance agricultural productivity and ecosystem health.
 * Reducing land-use conflicts between herders and farmers by implementing sustainable grazing practices.
 * Improving food security by promoting sustainable agricultural techniques that boost crop yields and resilience.
 * Building community resilience through capacity-building programs that empower local farmers, pastoralists, and youth with the knowledge and skills to sustainably manage natural resources.
 * Fostering gender equality by actively involving women and marginalized groups in all aspects of the project.
 
 [![IMG-8934.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/6qDJdSN4/IMG-8934.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/MfbFw9Hz)
 
 Key Regenerative Activities:
 1. Land Mapping and Analysis: Utilizing GIS and remote sensing technology, we will monitor land cover, water resources, and assess soil health. This data-driven approach helps track landscape changes and manage risks related to drought, bushfires, and temperature stress. It also supports our efforts to measure carbon sequestration over time.
 
 2. Soil Health Restoration: The project focuses on restoring soil fertility and biodiversity. We will train 100 local farmers in regenerative agriculture techniques, including crop rotation, biofertilizer production, and organic pest management. This intensive 100-hour program will empower farmers to adopt sustainable land-use practices that improve long-term soil health.
 
 3. Sustainable Pasture Management and Reforestation: To mitigate conflicts over land and reduce overgrazing, we will train 50 livestock breeders in sustainable pasture management. Additionally, 3,000 trees will be planted to help restore the local ecosystem, balance land use, and sequester carbon.
 
 4. Conflict Management Committees: To address the recurring disputes over land access, we will establish conflict management committees. These committees will host monthly meetings to delegate project responsibilities, mediate disputes, and promote collaborative decision-making.
 
 5. Public Awareness and Education: The project will engage over 250 community members annually to raise awareness about the importance of soil biodiversity and sustainable land-use practices. Educational workshops and community discussions will be a key component of this effort.
 
 6. Technical Skills Development: We will train 10 young community members in GIS and remote sensing techniques to monitor land degradation, drought, and wildfire risks. This technical training will help build local capacity for sustainable resource management.

 Two videos share our recent work through the voices of farmers and community members directly involved:
 
 Agrarian Trust: A Gift of Land Justice - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhOPsxyyMmI
 
 Onward, and Upward: A Victory for Community Ownership - https://www.agrariantrust.org/onward-and-upward-a-victory-for-community-ownership/
 
 We understand it to be in our collective interest to support the kinds of relationships, social and economic, that sustain the ecological integrity of land and a just, equitable food system. These principles represent our core values and guide us in our daily work to transform farmland ownership and tenure. We are committed to: The commons; racial equity and the just transition of land; openness, listening, and collaboration; and agroecological and regenerative practices.
 
 Our latest project is focused on securing land for an innovative urban farming hub on 8.5 acres in Omaha as well as a large-scale agroforestry project on 305 acres near Lyons, Nebraska.
 
 We are currently working in four new locations to form commons to benefit next-generation farmers, with two new commons forming in upstate New York, one in Texas, and another in Nebraska. As we prioritize projects that create opportunities for land access and secure tenure that benefit dispossessed people and communities, we are working largely with immigrant, displaced indigenous, and refugee farmers on these particular projects.
 
 We are seeking support for a newly forming Agrarian Commons in Nebraska led by Agrarian Trust in partnership with Comunidad Maya Pixan Ixim (CMPI). Since 2007, CMPI has built powerful relationships and partnerships within a multi-generational, multiracial coalition that will support the community in building a regenerative agriculture training center and agroforestry system on 305 acres near Lyons, NE.
 
 This 305-acre land was formerly the home of a conventional soy and corn farm and will be transformed into a center for sustainable agriculture and environmental stewardship working at scale.
 
 The site will offer hands-on training in large-scale green infrastructure, including solar battery storage, composting, and low-tillage farming practices. By maintaining 305 acres with regenerative agriculture practices, the site will help sequester carbon, improve soil health, and protect water quality by reducing the runoff of harmful chemical fertilizers. Both the North Omaha and Lyons projects are designed to complement each other, offering urban and rural residents the chance to gain critical skills in climate resilience and sustainable practices.
 
 This project would benefit tremendously from additional support as it is in its early stages of purchasing land. We are purchasing 305 acres at approximately $3.7M by December 2024.
 
 We have raised 97% of the land costs and need to focus on raising funds to fill gaps related to the cost of land as well as infrastructure to support the development of agroforestry systems, regenerative practices, as well as PV and EV charging infrastructure to dramatically lower the carbon footprint of each farm.
 
 By raising approximately $100,000 we will complete our fundraiser and secure this land as a beacon of regenerative agriculture and community stewardship in perpetuity by holding it in a trust.
 
 Agrarian Trust currently participates in five federally funded grant programs, necessitating comprehensive regular reporting for financial and programmatic outcomes and utilizing both quantitative metrics and qualitative indicators. This evaluation includes extensive metrics on acreages under regenerative management, acres under conservation, farming practices used, numbers of farmers and community members served, and dozens more metrics. It is available to the general public online via the Results Verification System.
 
 (For example, here are the metrics associated with a current Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Grant: Building Equitable Farmland Tenure Models for Northeast Farmers - https://projects.sare.org/sare_project/ene21-169/)
 
 Our Executive Director, Jean Theron Willoughby, works with our team to catalyze community ownership and support for next-generation farmers. She was a founding advisor to Agrarian Trust starting in 2014, joined the Board of Directors, and was later Agrarian Trust‚Äôs first hired staff member. A long-time advocate for land justice in many forms, she sees community ownership and stewardship of farmland as essential to restoring the commons. As an example of her work beyond helping build Agrarian Trust's approach, she conducted a 6-month feasibility study for the Triangle Land Conservancy that resulted in this story finally coming to light in 2024:

 Our Commons Manager, Nathan Galaviz, serves on multiple Agrarian Commons boards to support existing Agrarian Commons land-based projects with real estate research, due diligence, transactional work, conservation easement, farm stewardship, management planning, and organizational as well as board administration. Nathan supports the development of emerging commons around the country in outreach, education, community engagement, and networking. His work has led directly to four new commons forming in the coming year.
 
 Agrarian Trust's Board of Directors is also deeply engaged in land restoration and environmental projects. Our current Board President, Fran Miller, serves as Senior Staff Attorney from The Center for Agriculture and Food Systems at Vermont Law and Graduate School. She regularly presents at conferences on major issues facing land regenerators, from the legal side of operating a farm and collectively owning/managing farmland to heirs' property, and other significant legal issues facing farmers and their families. Her wisdom, skill, and guidance have been invaluable in Agrarian Trust's development of the Agrarian Commons legal approaches to collective ownership and stewardship.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/643/41

It securely manages and distributes encrypted data, such as credentials and other sensitive information, across distributed networks. Users maintain full control over their secrets without relying on third parties, using a peer-to-peer network where they communicate directly to share and manage secrets. This approach prioritizes privacy, security, and user sovereignty.
 
 Polykey enables decentralized secret management by allowing nodes to manage encrypted databases distributed across the network. Instead of depending on centralized services, Polykey‚Äôs nodes handle secrets in a way that is both secure and resilient. All communication and data sharing between nodes are end-to-end encrypted, ensuring only authorized parties can access the information. Users create vaults to store and share secrets, which can be synchronized across devices and nodes, providing seamless and secure access. The platform employs sigchains, immutable ledgers that record the actions of each node, enhancing transparency and accountability. Its peer-to-peer networking eliminates intermediaries, reducing vulnerabilities and ensuring robustness.
 
 Polykey delivers significant impact by granting users full sovereignty over their sensitive information. It allows individuals and organizations to manage cryptographic secrets without outsourcing trust to centralized entities like cloud providers, addressing the security risks associated with centralization. The platform aligns with the growing trend toward decentralized infrastructure, particularly in areas like Web3, where decentralization is essential for ensuring privacy, security, and resilience.
 
 Polykey enhances security by focusing on inside-out protection, securing data at the source rather than relying on external perimeter defenses. This method reduces exposure to external threats such as data breaches or third-party compromises. For enterprises, Polykey revolutionizes secret management, particularly across distributed systems and DevOps pipelines, by providing a decentralized solution that eliminates the risks tied to centralized key management. Polykey integrates efficiently into enterprise environments, offering a secure, decentralized approach to managing sensitive data.
 
 In addition to its enterprise applications, Polykey plays a crucial role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain ecosystems by enabling secure, peer-to-peer value transfers. The platform extends beyond key management, supporting secure and decentralized network architectures. Polykey represents a fundamental shift toward decentralized, user-controlled secret management, addressing the growing concerns about centralized control over sensitive data while providing enhanced privacy, security, and operational resilience.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/609/42

 # Other Activities
 
 **Industry Reports** - We released the 2024 editions of our cornerstone industry report, [The State of ReFi](https://carboncopy.news/reports/state-of-refi-2024/), in February in coordination with ReFi DAO and [The Impact DePIN Report](https://carboncopy.news/reports/impact-depin-2024/) in July in coordination with Arkreen, Switch Electric, and Shamba Network.
 
 **Regenerative Self-Assessment** - We have launched a survey based on the research of [Kate Bennett](https://au.linkedin.com/in/ktlbennett) to help ReFi/Web3 projects become more regenerative in their organisation and impact. 
 
 **Articles & Interviews** - We are slowly building a team of writers that produce rich analytical articles on ReFi topics, with a specific focus on localised impact. Example: [Exploring ReFi's Potential in Nigeria](https://carboncopy.news/features/exploring-refi-potential-nigeria/)
 
 **X Spaces** - We have started to host monthly X Spaces around topics relevant to the ReFi space. We've so far discussed the GG20 Climate Round with Climate Coordination Network, the Impact DePIN Report with Arkreen, Switch Electric, and Shamba Network, and the launch of our project database with Pranav Khanna. 
 
 **Weekly ReFi recaps** - We aggregate the news, wins, content, and thoughts from the ReFi space each week into a single article so stakeholders can stay up to do with what's happening. Example: [This Week in ReFi: July 20th-26th](https://carboncopy.news/this-week-in-refi/july-20th-26th-2024/)
 
 **ReFi News Feed** - We aggregate news from across the ReFi space into a single RSS feed that anyone can subscribe to or integrate into their projects. As the ReFi space grows, we see this as an important source of truth for crypto and tech media outlets.
 
 # Roadmap
 
 Looking forward, we are currently working on the following:
 
 ## 1) Impact metric integration on project profile pages
 
 At the heart of our mission is the desire to help ReFi projects demonstrate and promote their impact. To that end, we are working towards integrating impact data directly on the project profile and category profile pages. We have already integrated data for 20 projects.
 
 ## 2) ReFi Impact Dashboard
 
 With project data integrated, it will allow us to put together an aggregated dataset of impact across the ReFi space. An early beta version is expected in October.
 
 ## 3) Community database management
 
 We want the ReFi project database to remain a public good. As such, we are aiming for a community approach where decisions regarding the database are not made by us. This would involve allowing projects to claim their profile page by purchasing an NFT for a modest sum.
 
 ## 4) 2025 editions of the State of ReFi and Impact DePIN reports
 
 We aim to use this year's reports plus the data we are aggregating to produce richer, more insightful reports in 2025.
 
 ## 5) Latin American and Southeast Asian content
 
 We are looking to expand the geographic scope of our content and offer analysis from wherever ReFi is making impact.

 Filmfund.eth: Redefining Crypto Narrative - How Crypto and Its Community Are Portrayed
 
 Filmfund.eth is a platform designed to transform how cryptocurrency and its community are portrayed in the media. 
 Founded by an experienced filmmaker and university lecturer 113kw with a passion for both cinema and the crypto ecosystem, the project aims to reshape the way the general public perceives crypto, focusing on positive and impactful narratives through documentaries, films, and series, while also giving the crypto community a platform to react to films, documentaries, and TV series that already exist.
 
 
 Today, most portrayals of cryptocurrency in film and television lean heavily toward scams, fraud, and other illicit activities, reinforcing harmful stereotypes and misconceptions. 
 These depictions have ignored the many inspiring individuals who use crypto to drive meaningful change, promote decentralization, and foster innovation across industries, especially public goods. Filmfund.eth was born out of frustration with these one-sided portrayals and seeks to highlight the good-hearted, creative, and visionary people who are making a difference in the crypto space.
 
 
 As a decentralized platform (DAO), Filmfund.eth allows the community to play an active role in shaping the stories that are told. 
 The platform not only supports film and media production but also serves as a space for critical engagement. Users can rate and review crypto-centric films, documentaries, and TV series, offering their insights and reactions to the stories told about cryptocurrency. 
 This interactive feature ensures that the public has a say in how the crypto narrative evolves, gathering all the information in one place.
 
 
 The platform also invites filmmakers to submit scripts that portray cryptocurrency and its community in a positive light. 
 These submissions aim to emphasize the true potential of blockchain technology to revolutionize industries and benefit society. By focusing on narratives that highlight innovation, decentralization, and public good, Filmfund.eth hopes to create a more balanced and accurate portrayal of the crypto world.
 
 
 The first funded project will be a documentary that profiles some of the most inspiring figures within the crypto space‚Äîspecifically those who operate at the intersection of art, cryptocurrency, and public goods. This documentary will feature a selection of fine artists who are using NFTs to explore new dimensions of digital art while contributing to the public good through blockchain initiatives. This documentary will set the tone for the type of stories Filmfund.eth is dedicated to sharing, showing the world the positive impact of crypto on individuals, communities, and industries.
 
 
 At the heart of Filmfund.eth is its commitment to decentralization and community-driven storytelling. As the platform grows, it will evolve into a fully operational DAO, where users earn governance tokens by voting on which projects should be funded. 
 This democratic model ensures that the content produced through Filmfund.eth is aligned with the values and priorities of its community. By submitting reviews, voting on projects, or contributing their own scripts, users become active participants in shaping the narrative around cryptocurrency.
 
 
 Beyond producing films and documentaries, Filmfund.eth aims to be a hub for education and outreach. 
 Through partnerships with crypto communities, film universities, film festivals, and educational workshops, the platform seeks to foster a deeper understanding of blockchain technology and its real-world applications. By demystifying crypto and telling stories that focus on its positive impact, Filmfund.eth aims to inspire audiences and encourage them to see the technology and its people in a new light.
 
 
 Ultimately, Filmfund.eth is not just a platform for filmmaking‚Äîit is a movement dedicated to changing the way the world perceives cryptocurrency. 
 Through transparency, community engagement, and ethical storytelling, Filmfund.eth is poised to revolutionize how crypto and its people are portrayed, ensuring that the true stories of this innovative space are told and celebrated.
 
 
 Status of the Project
 
 Filmfund.eth is currently in BETA, with a functional website at www.filmfundeth.com where users can review crypto-related movies. We also have a demo of our Web3 app, accessible at https://filmfund.113kw.net/demo. 
 The documentary is well-prepared, and we've been collecting footage with artists over the years. 
 However, as FILMFUND.ETH is a complex project, we consider it still in its early stages, with significant groundwork already laid through networking, community building, and initial development efforts.
 
 As the dream project of its founder 113kw Kristina Weiserova, a filmmaker and film university instructor with extensive experience, Filmfund.eth has been actively engaging with both the crypto and film communities, both online and in-person. This includes attending multiple conferences and hackathons, where the project has received positive feedback and encouragement from key stakeholders in the crypto space.
 To date, the project has participated in three hackathons‚Äîtwo in real life and one online‚Äîwhere valuable progress was made in developing the Filmfund.eth app. 
 Despite the challenges of working with limited funding, these hackathons helped refine the concept, gather feedback, and attract early interest from developers and industry experts. The team has been diligently working on the app‚Äôs design, though the lack of financial resources has slowed the pace of development.
 
 Over the years, the founder has been gathering extensive notes and feedback, continually refining the concept of Filmfund.eth and adjusting its direction to better meet the needs of the community. This iterative process has sharpened the vision for the platform‚Äôs potential as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), where the community plays a pivotal role in deciding which film projects to fund.
 In addition to app development, Filmfund.eth has made substantial progress on its first documentary project. The founder has assembled a talented team of filmmakers and is in active contact with several subjects who will be featured in the documentary. These individuals are continuously making strides in the fields of crypto and public goods, representing the kind of positive stories Filmfund.eth seeks to highlight. The documentary will showcase the inspiring work of key figures within the crypto space and spotlight NFT artists who are pushing the boundaries of digital art.
 While the project has strong momentum and community interest, securing further funding is essential to fully realize the vision for Filmfund.eth. With financial support, the team is poised to accelerate development and production, allowing them to bring both the platform and its first documentary to a broader audience. Visit www.filmfundeth.com and try for yourself.
 
 Corporate Governance or Decision-Making Structure
 
 Filmfund.eth operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), designed to empower the community in the decision-making process regarding which projects receive funding and how resources are allocated. The governance structure is rooted in transparency, community engagement, and inclusivity, with the long-term goal of ensuring that the voices of filmmakers, creatives, and crypto enthusiasts are represented.
 
 At the initial stages, the governance structure will be guided by the founder and two ‚ÄúFunding Fathers‚Äù‚Äîtwo early supporters who contributed financially during the project's early development. These three key backers will have an influential role in the early decisions regarding project direction and funding. However, as the platform evolves, decision-making power will gradually shift toward the community through the distribution of tokens.
 
 As part of the DAO‚Äôs governance, token holders will have the ability to vote on which projects should be funded, ensuring that the platform operates in a democratic and decentralized manner. The token-based voting system allows the community to actively shape the future of the platform by participating in key decisions, such as which films, documentaries, or TV series will be produced. This system enables contributors of all backgrounds to have a stake in Filmfund.eth‚Äôs success.
 
 In addition to voting on projects, the platform encourages users to review and comment on content related to cryptocurrency, including existing films, documentaries, and TV series. The comments and reviews section is designed to foster community engagement and critical discourse. To enhance transparency, the platform will differentiate between reviews and comments from general users and those from DAO members, ensuring that the feedback provided by community stakeholders is clearly visible and given appropriate weight.
 
 Ultimately, Filmfund.eth‚Äôs decision-making model is a hybrid approach: beginning with the guidance of the ‚ÄúFunding Fathers,‚Äù and progressively transitioning to a fully community-driven DAO structure. As more users engage with the platform and receive tokens, the DAO will continue to grow, allowing for more diverse input and democratic control over the future of Filmfund.eth and its projects.
 
 What is your inspiration?
 
 In the words of the founder, 113kw: 
 ""The inspiration behind Filmfund.eth stems from a deep frustration with how cryptocurrency is portrayed in mainstream media, especially on platforms like Netflix and in popular documentaries. There is a stark difference between the negative, often sensationalized depiction of crypto in the media and the reality of the crypto community I have come to know through my experiences attending various conferences around the world. During these events, I encountered so many incredible people‚Äîindividuals who may have found financial success through crypto but are now using their wealth to give back to communities, support those in need, and drive positive change.
 This disconnect between how the general public sees crypto and how it is portrayed in media is one of the core motivations for creating Filmfund.eth. I want to reshape that narrative and highlight the good-hearted, innovative individuals in the space who are genuinely working to build a better future.
 My personal background plays a large role in this project as well. I have been involved in both the film industry and the crypto world for many years‚Äîfirst with Bitcoin, then Ethereum, and now other crypto projects. At the same time, I‚Äôve worked in the film business since 2005, and I currently teach at a film school, sharing my passion for cinema with the next generation of filmmakers. As a lover of film history, I am deeply passionate about storytelling and believe that cinema has the power to shift perspectives and change narratives.
 These experiences and passions are the driving forces behind Filmfund.eth. I want to leverage the power of film and storytelling to create a more balanced and positive representation of crypto, reflecting the real-world impact and the inspiring individuals behind the technology.""

These libraries and tools are designed to speed up development time, reduce errors, increase decentralization, and improve the overall experience of building trustworthy applications using attestations.
 
 ## **EAS SDK**
 The EAS SDK simplifies interaction with EAS contracts, allowing developers to integrate attestations into their projects without directly interacting with the smart contracts. This reduces complexity and potential errors, enhancing development efficiency and security.
 
 **Key Features:**
 - **Create** onchain and offchain attestations
 - **Revoke** onchain and offchain attestations
 - **Batch** multiple attestations in a single call
 - **Delegate** attestations and specify who pays the gas fee
 - **Timestamp** offchain attestations onchain
 - **Register** schemas easily
 - **Create** private data attestations for selective disclosure
 
 Explore the SDK: [ethereum-attestation-service/eas-sdk](https://github.com/ethereum-attestation-service/eas-sdk)
 
 ## **Transitive Trust SDK**
 
 The Transitive Trust SDK is a TypeScript library implementing a Transitive Trust Graph system for computing trust scores in peer-to-peer reputation systems. It provides tools to calculate and propagate trust within networks, offering an alternative to EigenTrust, particularly useful when social trust and reputation are important.
 
 **Features:**
 - **Create** directed graphs with nodes and weighted edges
 - **Compute** trust scores between nodes
 - **Handle** both positive and negative trust weights
 - **Efficient** score propagation using a priority queue
 
 **Resources:**

 ## **EAS Indexing Service**
 The EAS Indexing Service is an open-source library that allows developers to quickly deploy their own EAS indexer on any EVM-compatible chain where EAS contracts are deployed. 
 
 This enables developers to focus on attestations and schemas relevant to their specific use cases, rather than managing an extensive list of irrelevant attestations. It also promotes decentralization, as teams can run their own indexers instead of relying on centralized services.
 
 **Features:**
 - **Deploy** a custom offchain indexer 
 - **Tailor** indexing to specific attestations and schemas
 - **Enable** self-hosted indexers to enhance decentralization

 on-chain realtime hack prevention
 we are building on-chain firewalls
 What is an On-Chain Smart Contract Firewall?
 Smart contract hacks have been plaguing DeFi protocols, bridges, and more.
 
 Today, in order to defend themselves, protocols perform audits, open bug bounties, and implement monitoring.
 
 All of these steps are absolutely crucial. Nevertheless, whenever a vulnerability is discovered by an attacker, most exploits can drain funds in a very short period of time, sometimes even within a single transaction. To prevent these hacks from happening, we need an on-chain tool.
 
 You can think of the Smart Contract Firewall as an additional layer of security for DeFi protocols.
 
 Our Firewall is a set of Solidity Smart Contracts that allow you to:
 
 Define critical parameters for your protocol (e.g., TVL) and track these parameters over time.
 
 Detect that a transaction (or multiple) is causing the protocol to operate outside its normal activity (e.g., unusual liquidity outflow, indicative of a potential hack happening).
 
 Implement a set of protective measures, including transaction blocking, protocol pausing, fund freezing, or controlled fund withdrawal, before the transaction is committed and funds exit the protocol.
 
 The Firewall provides a way to detect abnormal changes in your protocol directly on-chain, that could be indicative of a hack. That means that you can act upon abnormal activity, whenever it occurs, directly on the blockchain.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/609/46

 ‚úÖ eth.limo supports every ENS compatible storage layer! Users can utilize IPFS, Arweave and Swarm contenthashes.
 
 ‚úÖ CCIP-Read for L2 and off-chain lookups are also supported!
 
 ‚úÖEmoji and unicode domains supported! [üòÇüòÇüòÇ.eth.limo](https://xn--g28haa.eth.limo/)
 
 ‚úÖ Limo now supports on-demand @ensdomains subdomain certificates!
 What does this mean? You can now automatically issue a certificate for ENS subdomains without requesting one from us! 
 How does this work? Once you submit an HTTP request for your name (i.e. app.myname.eth. limo), we'll attempt to issue the certificate in the background. Usually this process takes 1-2m and during that time you might need to keep refreshing the page in your browser. Once the certificate has been issued you'll be able to visit your subdomain on eth.limo.
 
 
 ‚úÖ DNS over HTTPS (DoH) Resolver DNS over HTTPS (DoH) resolver. We now offer an easy to use DNS resolver for ENS domains. The DoH resolver can be integrated with applications for native ENS resolution, or even your browser! We feature both JSON and DNS wire format responses with DNSLink support. This means you can configure your local IPFS client to resolve ENS domains directly from us with the following command:
 `ipfs config --json DNS.Resolvers '{""eth."": ""https://dns.eth.limo/dns-query""}'`
 For example if you then requested vitalik.eth, a DNS query would be constructed (https://dns.eth.limo/dns-query?name=vitalik.eth&type=TXT) which would return:
 >dnslink=/ipfs/QmQhCuJqSk9fF58wU58oiaJ1qbZwQ1eQ8mVzNWe7tgLNiD/
 Which would instruct your IPFS client to retrieve the CID above. Consult our documentation for implementation details.
 [Documentation](https://github.com/ethlimo/documentation)
 
 ‚úÖ Chauffeur - Run a local infrastructure stack for resolving ENS domains. https://github.com/ethlimo/chauffeur
 
 ‚úÖHTTP Object Caching - Improving content retrieval times is always a priority for the eth.limo team. After several weeks of careful testing we have fully implemented static content object caching, globally for all eth.limo resolved names. This means that we will cache content retrieved from IPFS and save it for later retrieval. The result being much faster page load times for all static content.
 
 ‚úÖBase32 and Base36 Encoding for IPFS/IPNS - We have updated both the eth.limo gateway and our DNS over HTTPS service to explicitly use Base32 encoding for IPFS CIDs and Base36 for IPNS peer IDs.
 
 ‚úÖLIMO takes public gateway services a step further by enforcing strong privacy guarantees such as never logging IP addresses or engaging in TCP fingerprinting. Limo now actively blocks FLoC (Federated Learning of Cohorts). This is a Google developed algorithm that tracks and correlates users based on their browsing history. FLoC enables advanced fingerprinting capabilities and greatly undermines online privacy and anonymity.

 üéâ2024 Future endeavorsüéâ
 
 We‚Äôre busy working on the following updates & new features:
 ‚ñ™Ô∏èMulti-region CDN deployment (better performance and reliability)
 ‚ñ™Ô∏èENS resolution manager app
 ‚ñ™Ô∏èContinued work on ENS native DNS resolver in anticipation of the .eth TLD being welcomed into the ICANN gTLD namespace (limo-web3-dns)
 ‚ñ™Ô∏èGateway as a Service implementation of the eth.limo API
 ‚ñ™Ô∏èImproved IPv6 support
 ‚ñ™Ô∏èLight client fallback from Alchemy RPC API
 ‚ñ™Ô∏èResearch on HTTP Header Standards for ENS dWebsites
 
 HTTP headers are tricky to get right, even more so in decentralised environments. Certain browser features (like SharedArrayBuffer) can only be used in a ‚ÄúSame-Origin‚Äù context, which requires the use of certain server side headers to be returned to the client. With this in mind, we are investigating the best way for users to define their own header and value pairs at the ENS record level. This would be a new standard for ENS HTTP gateways and permit users to fully leverage all available browser features irrespective of how the content is accessed (i.e. gateway or web3 native browsers).
 
 
 Why do we need ETH.LIMO?
 
 ‚úîÔ∏èCore internet infrastructure is becoming increasingly centralized and as such, several existential threats have emerged that undermine the principles of an decentralized, open and free internet:
 
 ‚úîÔ∏èLack of non-commercial infrastructure
 
 ‚úîÔ∏èOpacity of terms of service agreements and moderation policies
 
 ‚úîÔ∏èProliferation of proprietary browser extensions which require centralized services 
 
 ‚úîÔ∏èThe erosion of the ‚Äúcommons‚Äù and ‚Äúpublic space‚Äù
 
 ‚úîÔ∏èWeb 3.0 adoption is still nascent
 
 ‚úîÔ∏èMost browsers cannot natively access ENS/IPFS
 
 
 For end users, this means a limited selection of poor quality services that increasingly resemble a cable TV package. Accessing the dWeb can be a frustrating experience. For dApp developers, this leads to a limited selection of platforms and services in addition to lost revenue.
 
 The LIMO project brings additional resiliency to dApps by providing an alternative means of access as a public good. As the decentralized web continues to grow, it is imperative that community projects facilitate the transition from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0.
 
 The LIMO project is organized around the following founding principles:
 
 1. Operate ETH.LIMO as a public good.
 
 2. Establish community governance and oversight.
 
 a. Provide support and technical guidance for builders and users.
 
 3. Work towards building a truly decentralized ENS/IPFS gateway service and global CDN.
 
 4. Build a world-class developer platform for dweb sites, including integrated analytics reporting and traffic management deployment tooling for commonly used web2 patterns such as A/B testing, canary and blue/green deployments.
 
 5. A commitment to open source software and the advancement of web3 through education, best practices, evangelism, and public accessibility.

GG22,Regen Citizens Genesis,Will Ruddick,0xba0FEE8490118FC4f46Bd0974D7BF93d0e2f1064,https://twitter.com/wor,https://github.com/grassrootseconomics,Will Ruddick,https://willruddick.substack.com,APPROVED,"**Reviving Ancestral Wisdom through Commitment Pooling via regen web3**
 
 I have dedicated the past 15 years to pioneering regenerative economic systems that weave together ancestral land management practices and modern decentralized technology. As a citizen in the regen web3 movement and the founder of Grassroots Economics Foundation, my work focuses on leveraging *Commitment Pooling*, a protocol rooted in indigenous mutual service traditions such as Rotational Labor Associations (ROLAs), now enhanced with decentralized ledgers like blockchain. This approach fosters a regenerative financial ecosystem where community coordination, ecological stewardship, and social equity are at the heart of economic activity.
 
 **Regenerative R&D Contributions:**
 My primary contribution to regenerative finance is the development of *Commitment Pooling*, a protocol that curates and aggregates community commitments to facilitate the fair exchange of resources. Drawing inspiration from pre-monetary practices found in cultures globally, including Kenya‚Äôs Mwerya tradition, Commitment Pooling has allowed communities to exchange labor and services using digital tokens formalized as *Community Asset Vouchers* (CAVs). These vouchers are integrated with blockchain technology and have facilitated over a million transactions.
 
 Through my work with over 120 communities, including refugee groups and rural villages, I have supported local ecosystems by restoring over 2,800 acres of syntropic agroforestry. I aim to expand this to 1 million acres over the next five years, using decentralized systems to pool commitments, facilitating exchanges that transcend traditional monetary limitations.
 
 **Education and Growth Efforts:**
 Education has always been central to my work. As part of Grassroots Economics, I‚Äôve developed training materials, simulation games, and hands-on workshops to empower community leaders and trainers. For over a decade, I‚Äôve focused on training ‚ÄúGrassroots Economists,‚Äù local champions who support their communities in developing and utilizing CAVs. These trainers ensure the sustainability of regenerative practices through workshops on ecosystem stewardship and decentralized finance (Developing Community Asset Vouchers and Commitment Pools).
 
 My educational initiatives have led to over 140 village groups adopting regenerative practices, and we‚Äôre on track to expand these practices exponentially by producing a new generation of trainers who support communities in creating their own local economies based on ecological sustainability.
 
 **Operational Support:**
 In collaboration with the Grassroots Economics team, we built the *Sarafu.Network*, which supports Community Asset Vouchers and Commitment Pools through blockchain technology. This system allows communities without smartphones or internet access to use USSD/SMS platforms to manage their economic commitments. This ensures even the most marginalized groups have access to decentralized financial systems.
 
 By creating systems that enable communities to issue their own digital vouchers (erc20 tokens) and link these to global liquidity pools and stable coins (such as cUSD), we ensure the sustainability of local economies. My work has allowed for the creation of systems that can seamlessly scale, connecting diverse bioregions to global regenerative finance systems.
 
 **Impact on Local Communities and Bioregions:**
 Through the development and implementation of Commitment Pooling and CAVs, my work at Grassroots Economics has impacted over 14,000 individuals annually, helping restore degraded lands, improve food security, and foster social cohesion in rural and peri-urban regions of Kenya and beyond. Communities that had lost their traditional land management practices are now revitalized through a combination of digital technology and ancestral wisdom, leading to ecological, social, and economic regeneration.
 
 My work has not only provided tangible benefits to local communities, such as increased food production and restored ecosystems, but has also fostered a larger global movement that connects indigenous practices with modern regenerative finance. I believe that by rebuilding our global ‚ÄúKaya,‚Äù a concept of communal living rooted in traditional Bantu culture, we can create a regenerative future for all.
 
 **Conclusion:**
 The essence of my work is about reclaiming the ancient wisdom of resource pooling and applying it through modern decentralized technologies to build a resilient and regenerative world. My contributions to the Regen Web3 movement through *Commitment Pooling* are already having a profound impact on communities and ecosystems across East Africa and the globe. Through continued innovation, education, and operational support, I aim to scale this impact further to rebuild ecological and economic resilience on a global scale.

 We‚Äôve been making HUGE progress so far in 2024: 
 
 Since August, we‚Äôve ran 2 quadratic funding rounds (making it a total of 8 QF rounds this year,) brought our donation platform to support 11 chains and networks now, launched the first iteration of our decentralized project verification system (using Devouch), and announced the first cohort of the Quadratic Accelerator (q/acc). q/acc is the precursor to ‚ÄúGurves‚Äù and is bringing us one step closer to [the holy grail of the Giveth roadmap](https://blog.giveth.io/the-power-of-giv-reimagining-public-goods-funding-1c5ab2a867e9) - making nonprofits profitable.
 
 
 [Giveth.io](https://giveth.io/) is an open source, radically transparent, user-friendly donation platform that allows anyone to open crypto funding portals by creating projects for positive impact, with zero added fees and no intermediaries. Donors are also rewarded for giving to a wide range of projects that cover the field of for-good ventures such as feeding the homeless, funding community currency projects, and promoting planetary well-being.
 
 Currently Giveth is live on Ethereum Mainnet, Gnosis Chain, Polygon PoS, OP Mainnet, Base, Polygon zkEVM, Celo, Ethereum Classic, Solana, Stellar, and Arbitrum.
 
 ## How it works
 
 Giveth goes beyond ‚Äújust donations‚Äù with the following features:
 
 * GIVbacks - Donors who give to verified public goods projects get rewarded with GIV. This flips the script on tax-deductible donation, creating a decentralized and borderless way of incentivizing donations.
 * GIVpower - Donors can lock their GIV tokens for GIVpower and use them to boost/curate projects on the platform. Projects with more GIVpower are ranked higher, and in turn, their donors are rewarded with more GIVbacks, similar to the veToken model. Top-boosted projects also appear higher on Giveth!
 * Quadratic Funding - The democratic matching program popularized by Gitcoin is also available on Giveth! Projects and donors enjoy multi-chain donation rounds with an easy and streamlined user experience.
 
 ## Who uses it
 
 Currently, over 5,800 projects have raised donations from over 17,800 donor addresses on Giveth.
 
 Projects who want to get to the next level can apply to be ‚ÄúVerified‚Äù as a public goods creator, providing information about their impact history and reputation at stake.
 
 ## Updates
 
 As we continue along into the final quarter of 2024, we are excited to announce some significant updates and future plans.
 
 ### Major milestones achieved last quarter
 
 * Ran 2 successful quadratic funding rounds start-to-finish, raising $100,000 for projects on Giveth through the matching pools of the GIV-ARB and the GIV-a-Palooza rounds, plus an additional $44,000 from donations!
 * Closed a partnership with Endaoment and welcomed over 3,600 registered nonprofit projects into Giveth‚Äôs DApp.
 * Launched Devouch - a decentralized vouching mechanism that lets people mint attestations and lend their reputation to projects they support.
 * Launched phase 1 of our decentralized project verification system, leveraging Devouch to empower trusted community members to vouch for impact projects.
 * Ran a ‚ÄúRecurring Donation Rally‚Äù, encouraging Giveth donors to set up donation streams.
 * Added support for Coinbase and Trust Wallet on Mobile & Desktop
 * Added stellar as an option for donating & fundraising in QF rounds and beyond.
 * Brought the GIVeconony to Polygon zkEVM, adding support for GIV staking, GIVbacks and GIVpower.

 ### Upcoming Goals - In Progress
 
 The following is a list of products and features that we are currently working on building: 
 
 * Improving QF round matching estimations, making use of COCM, to more accurately convey the impact of a particular donation on the matching funds.
 * Launch Season 3 of our Ambassador Program to empower a broader group of Giveth users.
 * Iterate upon our GIVbacks donor rewards program using a raffle system designed to encourage larger donations to verified public goods projects.
 * Expand our [GIVeconomy dune dashboard](https://dune.com/giveconomy/giveconomy) to include Polygon zkEVM, offering useful stats and information regarding GIV.
 * Create the MVP spec for Gurves (estimated to launch in 2025), to enable public goods projects to launch micro-economies backed by GIV.
 * Run the 1st q/acc round with a cohort of projects building on Polygon, enabling them to launch new token economies through a novel mechanism that combines QF and augmented bonding curves.
 
 ### Upcoming Goals - Under Research
 
 The following is a list of new products, partnerships, and features that we are considering adding to our roadmap near and long term. Our ability to execute on these goals is dependent on fundraising and the success of our economy, so if you want to support the Future of Giving, please add us to your cart and donate!
 
 * Bitcoin: Integrate Bitcoin to allow donors and projects to use Bitcoin for crowdfunding - enabling access to new audiences holding 56% of the total crypto market cap.
 * Donation Handler Smart Contract: Build infrastructure so that all donations pass through smart contracts, enabling custom logic to be added on top of donations made on Giveth in an on-chain and transparent way. 
 * GIVeconomy UX: Improve the UX design of the GIVeconomy to make it easier for users to understand project curation & donor rewards.
 * Recurring Donations UX: improve the design of recurring (streaming) donations to make it easier for donors to ‚Äúset it and forget it‚Äù.

 Forus is a cutting-edge privacy solution built on Ethereum, optimized for Arbitrum, leveraging advanced cryptography to protect users' financial privacy. By utilizing elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) cryptography, Forus generates unique stealth addresses for each transaction, allowing users to receive ETH and ERC20 tokens privately via a cryptographic link, without exposing their real wallet addresses.
 
 **How It Works:**
 1. **Elliptic Curve Cryptography & Forus Keys**: Forus uses ECDH cryptography to create a key pair (public and private). The public key forms a cryptographic link, which can be shared without revealing any association with the user‚Äôs actual blockchain address. This key generation process allows for the creation of multiple, independent Forus keys for enhanced flexibility.
  
 2. **Stealth Address Generation**: When a sender initiates a transaction, they use the shared public key to compute a stealth address through a real-time, off-chain operation, utilizing their own ephemeral private key. This ensures that every transaction is linked to a one-time, unpredictable stealth address, shielding both sender and receiver from any blockchain-based traceability.
 
 3. **Fund Retrieval & Privacy**: Receivers monitor the Forus contract for new transactions, derive the corresponding private key using their Forus secret, and access their funds in a secure, anonymous manner. The stealth address breaks any link between sender and receiver, ensuring complete privacy in on-chain financial interactions.
 
 **Built on Ethereum's Infrastructure**: Forus enhances the privacy layer on Ethereum and Arbitrum, which inherently prioritize transparency. By leveraging stealth addresses, Forus provides a practical solution to the transparency challenges of blockchain, making secure, untraceable transactions possible.
 
 **Innovations**: Forus is refining its relayer mechanism to allow users to pay transaction fees in ERC20 tokens, eliminating the need for ETH. Integration with Gelato enables automated transactions, enhancing user convenience. Additionally, cross-chain transfer capabilities and NFT support are in development, further expanding Forus‚Äô privacy-enhancing ecosystem.
 
 Forus merges cryptographic sophistication with Ethereum‚Äôs infrastructure, offering a secure, user-friendly solution for private financial transactions on Arbitrum.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/610/47

 LexClinic alpha was a successful minimum viable potential-charity:
 
 1. We walked many new web3 projects through our $300 legal risk checklist and 2 hour legal information session based on the project's answers to the checklist:
 
 * This enabled these web3 projects to make informed decisions about their legal future. 
 
 * It also taught law students how to properly interview projects about their legal needs and how to expand past not just thinking rationally about what the law means, which is taught in law schools, but also thinking creatively about how to ethically achieve the project's goals.
 
 * After going through the checklist, many projects progressed onto starting the 501(c)3 charity designation process with the *pro bono* support of one of the best law firms in our industry.
 
 2. We did some open source general legal research at low cost:
 
 * An obvious value-add since law students already spend quite a bit of their time doing legal research. The Clinic's research opportunities exposed them to key players in our industry as well as key concepts in our industry.
 
 3. Big picture: 
 
 * We figured out how to further our core value that **law is a public good** but is in a tragedy of the commons that needs to be rejuvenated. 
 
 * We will likely be considered an educational charity when we are ready to make the request during our transition to beta, while also doing actual applied work that has a big prosocial impact on prosocial impact projects.
 
 4. Insights:
 
 * After speaking with and learning from our friends at Endaoment, we realized that the accounting requirements for 501(c)3 status are too advanced for our alpha stage, and that we needed an accountable managerial layer in order to meet 501(c)3 requirements.
 
 * Trade schools teach with journeyperson apprenticeships, and in many jurisdictions this is still how lawyers learn to practice law. We can take this applied learning methodology and use it to low-cost help prosocial impact projects in an environment where legal costs are often unethically high.
 
 * We do not offer any confidentiality, and all projects work together in the open. This helps ensure projects do not try, on purpose or accidentally, to get legal services at the Clinic.
 
 * We learned to use the Clinic itself for legal engineering experiments, so-called dogfooding, as a safe way to take on applied legal engineering work. For instance, our [Hats Tree](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/10/26) that is continuing to be built as we transition from alpha to beta.
 
 We now have barred lawyers who graduated from LexClinic alpha! By being apprentices at the Clinic, they are Web3 literate lawyers.
 
 # present
 We are now transitioning to LexClinic beta:
 
 1. We have the Ixian Tech law firm managing the Clinic, so that we can ensure projects do not detrimentally rely on students.
 
 * One of the problems we experienced during the alpha stage was that we should in no way interfere with student academic performance while also being responsible with projects.
 
 2. The Clinic is now a $300/yr subscription or invite Patronage managed by Hats Protocol.
 
 * This makes onboarding simpler, and in theory should be easier to build out as a protocol so we can continue being as decentralized as is reasonable.
 
 3. Houses are deemphasized for now.
 
 * Critical mass was not big enough in the alpha stage to develop a 'surname legacy' culture, but we did successfully integrate existing projects as houses into the Clinic that wanted to use the Clinic's protocol for business logic, so we'll continue doing that.
 
 4. We are going to administer the [inverted-precedent](https://github.com/lexclinic/Grants) legal engineering grant invention.
 
 * The Clinic's test pilots should be a good fit for properly testing this important rough consensus and wisdom cultivating over time concept.

 A decentralized vault-based ENS renewal manager.
 
 ## Abstract
 
 The idea is simple. A single smart contract, that manages vault creation, top-up, and renewal. The vault owner can add a list of ENS names to the vault, and anyone can renew the names. The vault owner can top-up the vault with ETH, and the renewer can utilize the ETH for renewing the names. Part of the renewal fee is shared with the renewer, as such to incentivize the renewer to renew the names.
 
 ## Features
 - Creating vaults with multiple names 
 - Topping up vaults with Ether for rewards
 - Manually executing name reneval process for chosen name in selected vault
 - Withdrawing rewards for rescuing names from vaults
 
 ## Team
 
 This project was built together with [NevvDevv.eth](https://github.com/JustAnotherDevv) and [luc.eth](https://github.com/lucemans).
 
 ## Roadmap
 
 - Current V0 is live on Sepolia and allows only for manual name rescue execution. 
 - V1 that is in development right now should have it's first mainnet deployment, it will allow users to run their own rescue node software that can listen to new Ethereum blocks and automatically send transactions rescuing names with minimum setup.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/642/49

 This proposal requests funding to integrate Trustful with the Allo Protocol. By combining reputation data with Allo's transparent capital allocation system, we aim to enhance community-led decision-making in grant programs, making it more data-driven and impactful.
 
 ## What are we building:
 A Reputation Aggregator System designed to evaluate addresses (members, grants programs, DAOs, etc.). By aggregating onchain data such as past grantees, community support, defined milestones, detailed grant scopes, and contributions to the ecosystem, we aim to match high-quality grants with future builders. This approach ensures fairer resource allocation and supports data-driven decision-making for applicants. The integration with Allo Protocol is already part of the roadmap, enhancing transparent and efficient capital allocation.
 
 **The roadmap as follows:**
 
 Badges reputation system **[DONE]**
 Integration with Karma GAP **[DONE]**
 Creation of the v1 architecture with Badges, Scorers, and Issuers [DONE]
 ZK or other privacy tool implementation **[IN PROGRESS]**
 Integration with Allo Protocol **[RESEARCH PHASE]**
 
 ## Addressed problems: Verifiable Track Record of Past, Fair Resource Allocation, and Role Assignment
 
 1.1 Lack of a Verifiable Track Record: Many grants have funded unfinished projects or projects where the creator disappeared. This misallocation of resources wastes funding and undermines trust in the grant system. The integration with Allo Protocol will enhance verifiable data by aggregating past grantee performance, ensuring funds are directed to projects with proven track records and sustained engagement.
 
 1.2 Arbitrariness in Role Selection Decisions: Assigning roles based on verifiable reputation ensures that individuals with the most relevant knowledge and experience lead projects and evaluations. This reputation-based role assignment strengthens reviewer selection and supports those leading grants programs.
 
 2. Enhancing Grant Program Effectiveness Through Strategic Principles
 
 2.1 Fair Resource Allocation: The integration with Allo Protocol ensures resources are allocated based on the quality and potential impact of projects, using transparent and data-driven decision-making. Projects will be evaluated by their methodology, community impact, and sustainability, not just the requested amount.
 
 2.2 Quality of Impactful Projects: With Allo, we will emphasize projects that show innovation, technical feasibility, and clear execution strategies. Reputation data will contribute to evaluating work plans, partnerships, and measurable outcomes.
 
 2.3 Transparency and Accountability: Allo supports a transparent, accountable grant selection process by integrating public evaluation criteria, engaging multiple stakeholders, and implementing mechanisms for fund tracking.
 
 2.4 Promotion of Innovation and Collaboration: By encouraging collaboration through Allo's community-driven framework, we can foster ecosystem growth with challenges, mentoring, and networking opportunities for grantees.
 
 3. Enhanced Applicant/Project Quality
 
 3.1 Attracting High-Quality Applicants: Integrating with Allo enhances the reputation of the grants program, attracting applicants recognized for expertise and innovation. This approach ensures decisions are data-based, aligning with the program's goal of ecosystem growth.
 
 
 ## Why does this integration matter?
 
 - Advanced Technological Integration: Trustful will integrate with the Allo Protocol to match reputation data with transparent capital allocation for grants. This allows for efficient and credible funding decisions by connecting robust on-chain data with the allocation process. Users can access comprehensive, verifiable information about grants, enhancing the overall decision-making process.
 
 - Enhanced Transparency and Reliability: By combining Allo‚Äôs open-source capital allocation mechanism with Trustful‚Äôs reputation system, we provide transparent, data-driven insights into grant programs. This includes program clarity, reviewer quality, and platform usage metrics, ensuring reliable support and fostering trust among community members.
 
 - Improved Decision-Making: Integrating Trustful with Allo enhances decision-making by providing clear, data-backed metrics for evaluating grant programs. This ensures resources are allocated to high-impact projects with strong reputations, improving the fairness and effectiveness of capital distribution.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/636/5

 The Rec√¥ncavo da Guanabara Bay Bioregional Fund aims to restore ecological integrity and foster socioeconomic resilience within the Baixada Fluminense region of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This initiative addresses critical environmental and social challenges, including deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and socioeconomic inequality, impacting ecosystem services for approximately 14 million inhabitants in the wider region. Through the establishment of the Caminho do Rec√¥ncavo da Guanabara, a long-distance trail, the initiative connects diverse stakeholders, enhances community engagement, and promotes regenerative practices honoring the region's rich cultural heritage.
 
 Context and Need
 
 Overview of the Bioregion
 The Reconcavo da Guanabara Bioregion, encompassing the municipalities of Mag√©, Duque de Caxias, Guapimirim, and Cachoeiras de Macacu, has a history marked by complex socio-environmental dynamics. The mountain ranges surrounding the region, such as the Serra dos √ìrg√£os and the Serra da Estrela, are highly relevant to the landscape formation and water dynamics. The highest point in the region is Pedra do Sino, located in the Serra dos √ìrg√£os, with an altitude of 2,275 meters. The territorial identity is deeply influenced by the interaction between its communities and the rivers that flow through the region. Among the main rivers are the Estrela River and the Inhomirim River, which play a central role in the local economy and ecology. Once a prosperous economic hub during the colonial period, the region has suffered severe degradation over time due to uncontrolled industrialization, urban expansion, and poor land management. These factors have resulted in critical ecological and social challenges, particularly related to the Estrela and Inhomirim rivers
 - Environmental Degradation and Pollution: Inadequate land use in the cities of the Baixada Fluminense has severely impacted local ecosystems, with the siltation and pollution of essential rivers such as the Estrela and Inhomirim. Unregulated expansion, combined with the improper disposal of industrial and urban waste, deeply affects these water bodies. In Mag√© and Duque de Caxias, untreated sewage discharge and landfills, such as the now-closed Jardim Gramacho, overwhelm the rivers, impairing water supply and agriculture. Furthermore, the accumulation of waste and industrial pollution along these rivers has posed public health risks, while deforestation along riverbanks contributes to erosion and frequent flooding.
 - Biodiversity Loss: The region is part of the Atlantic Forest biome, recognized as a biodiversity hotspot, but only about 7% of the original forest cover remains, 5% has been recovered. Deforestation, driven by agricultural and urban expansion, threatens native species, many of which are at risk of extinction. In Guapimirim and Cachoeiras de Macacu, the remaining forest areas, including the Serra dos √ìrg√£os National Park, are vital for conservation but are also under pressure. Rivers like the Inhomirim, which flows through Guapimirim and Guanabara Bay, still host sensitive ecosystems, but their role in supporting biodiversity is threatened by pollution and improper land use.
 - Social Inequality: The Baixada Fluminense is characterized by stark social inequalities, with wealth concentrated in a few hands while widespread poverty persists. According to IBGE (Brazilian National Statistic Data) in cities like Mag√© and Duque de Caxias, more than 40% of the population lives below the poverty line. Many of these communities are composed of descendants of enslaved Africans, who historically settled in quilombos and remain socially and economically marginalized. The chronic lack of basic infrastructure, such as sanitation and education, is a recurring problem, and the degradation of the Estrela and Inhomirim rivers further exacerbates the difficulties of these communities, which depend on these water sources for consumption and agricultural production.
 - Urban Challenges: The accelerated and unregulated urbanization in the municipalities of the Baixada Fluminense has strained local infrastructure. In Duque de Caxias, rapid population growth without adequate planning has resulted in critical issues such as insufficient public transport, inadequate sewage systems, and frequent power outages. The unregulated growth has also affected rural areas, especially in Mag√© and Guapimirim, where informal settlements along riverbanks increase the risk of flooding. The expansion of favelas without access to basic services creates precarious living conditions, and the lack of proper solid waste management increases the region's vulnerability to environmental disasters, exacerbating the impact of extreme weather events.
 
 
 Our Initiative: Caminho do Rec√¥ncavo da Guanabara
 
 The initiative Caminho do Rec√¥ncavo da Guanabara is a 110 km long-distance trail that crosses five municipalities and connects 200,000 acres of nature which we are stewarding. This trail links three biohubs and passes through several conservation units, integrating key areas of ecological and cultural significance. The name reflects the deep heritage of the region, once a thriving economic and social hub during Portuguese colonization. By revitalizing this history, the trail promotes not only ecological restoration but also a reconnection with the cultural legacy of Guanabara Bay, fostering sustainable development and community engagement along its path.
 The Caminho do Rec√¥ncavo da Guanabara serves as a sustainable development model by:
 - Protecting and restoring the Atlantic Forest.
 - Developing agro-ecological markets for sustainable products.
 - Promoting community-based tourism to celebrate local heritage.
 
 Objectives
 
 1. Ecosystem Restoration: Re-establish ecological systems to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services.
 2. Socio-Economic Development: Create sustainable bioeconomy opportunities for local communities through a joint purpose and shared resources.
 3. Cultural Heritage Preservation: Acknowledge and empower the historical narrative and contributions of the African descendant population.
 
 Engagement with Stakeholders
 Key stakeholders involved in advancing this project include:
 - Sinal Do Vale: A major asset is our strong Biohub at Sinal do Vale, which has earned the trust of the community and has a proven track record in driving change. It excels at prototyping innovative, place-based solutions that are community-driven and locally supported.
 - Movimento Viva √Ågua: A local capacity builder, collaborating with significant organizations for ecosystem restoration.
 - Beyonders Collective: Our collaboration with Beyonders, a catalyst agency,, strengthens the project by facilitating gatherings, providing leadership and coaching, and offering business development and capacity-building support for various regional initiatives.
 - Ecoaba: A local agronomic technical advisor who has relations with many farmers in the area and has successfully implemented regional agroforestry projects in the past.
 Bioregional stakeholders: Our extensive network of bioregional stakeholders is another key resource. Over the past 20 years, we have built strong coalitions and guided these stakeholders toward a shared vision of sustainable development.
 - UN Decade Flagship Connection: Our deep ties to the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, with Thais serving as co-chair, enable us to share insights globally and advocate for this model on an international stage.
 - Additionally, our three Biohubs are part of UNESCO‚Äôs Advanced Centres for the Mata Atlantica Biosphere Reserve, and we are recognized as a certified Global Ecosphere Retreat by The Long Run, meeting 83 sustainability indicators.
 
 Through collaborative governance involving local communities and Indigenous Peoples, we will enhance sustainability and participatory decision-making.
 
 Key Achievements 
 
 - Trail Mapping: We have established an officially recognised trail, consisting of nine segments that showcase the region's rich ecological diversity. Along the trail, we mapped 113 farms to assess their primary agricultural practices, identifying key challenges and opportunities to expand agroecology. Our survey revealed a wide variety of production systems and pinpointed priority areas for intervention, aimed at strengthening the agroecological corridor network and enhancing the economic resilience of local farmers.
 - Biodiversity Monitoring: In collaboration with UFRJ researchers, we have developed sustainable data collection and analysis processes to monitor local biodiversity effectively.
 - Youth Empowerment: We have trained 230 at-risk youth in entrepreneurial skills through targeted programs, helping them create new opportunities and fostering a new generation of leaders.
 - Community Infrastructure: We are upgrading infrastructure to support tourism and preserve local heritage sites, driving both economic growth and cultural preservation.
 - Business Model Prototyping: The Madre Frutos and Aboca projects have successfully moved beyond the pilot stage and are poised for expansion with new funding opportunities.
 
 Our initiative serves as a catalyst for incubating a regenerative value chain in the Rec√¥ncavo da Guanabara region, focused on both ecological restoration and community development. This model holds the potential to scale, serving as a blueprint for other bioregions around the world.
 
 A Global Opportunity
 
 We have a unique opportunity to demonstrate a path forward as global attention turns to Brazil, with the upcoming Rio G20 and COP30 in Bel√©m. Situated within the UN Flagship Mata Atlantica, one of the world's most biodiverse regions, we still have a chance to make a lasting impact. Success in this challenging environment could serve as a beacon of hope for ecological restoration worldwide.
 
 While we have the necessary partners, expertise, and conditions, we lack the financial frameworks to scale our impact. With Thais as co-chair of the UN Decade of Ecosystem Restoration, we have a powerful platform to share our progress and insights, but we need financial support to turn this vision into reality.
 
 
 Funding Requirements
 
 To expand the impact and sustainability of this initiative, we seek to raise a total of $2.2 million, allocated as follows:
 - Ecosystem Restoration Projects: $400,000
 Reforestation and biodiversity monitoring.
 - Community Engagement and Capacity Building: $150,000
 - Training programs and workshops for local communities.
 - Bioeconomy projects $1.000.000

It brings engineering discipline to the design, verification, and optimization of these complex new forms of economic coordination. 
 
 When you support token engineering, you‚Äôre helping to build an important new form of public goods. Civil engineering exists so people can feel safe crossing a bridge at rush hour without having to read its blueprints. Token engineering serves a similar role for complex crypto-economic systems. It builds an engineering-backed assurance layer that enables us trust that these systems are safe and that they will do what they say they do. This newly emerging discipline is critical to fostering the public trust needed for widespread adoption of Web3 technologies. 
 
 
 Since the opening of its bonding curve in January 2021, the Token Engineering Commons (TEC) has granted some $600,000 to token engineering projects. In addition to our own direct grant making, the TEC has run numerous Gitcoin grant rounds, including as a featured Community Round. Through these efforts, the TEC has funded the development of the [Token Engineering Academy‚Äôs](http://tokenengineering.net/) free Token Engineering [Fundamentals](http://tokenengineering.net/explore/) course and its research into tooling for AI-powered token engineering. It has also provided critical funding to the [Inverter Network‚Äôs](http://www.inverter.network/) open library of programmable workflows, the [Bonding Curve Research Group](http://medium.com/bonding-curve-research-group), and [CadCAD](http://cadcad.org) simulation tooling, among many other projects.
 
 The Token Engineering Commons (TEC) has made significant contributions to the Web3 grants ecosystem through the development and implementation of innovative funding mechanisms and grant allocation strategies. One of our key achievements is the creation of the [Tunable Quadratic Funding (TQF) mechanism](http://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/expertise-and-quadratic-funding-bd4f0c5c3e23), which enhances traditional Quadratic Funding by incorporating on-chain signals from donors. This funding method allows grant round operators to amplify the voting signal of donors that exhibit particular attributes valued by their community. Examples include Subject Matter Expertise (SME), token holding, attestations of community contributions, and reputation (e.g. delegates and badgeholders). Many of these TQF signals also contribute to improving sybil resistance and overall allocation effectiveness.

GG22,GG22 OSS - dApps and Apps,ggframe,0x63b1EfC5602C0023BBb373F2350Cf34c2E5F8669,https://twitter.com/ggframe_xyz,https://github.com/gg-frame,ggframe,https://ggframe.xyz,APPROVED,"**ggframe is a public goods for public goods, a farcaster frame designed to make it easier for users to donate to the Gitcoin Grant.**
 
 Open Source Software (OSS) and public goods developers often face financial challenges because they are not associated with any specific country. This disconnect from national structures means they don't benefit from the redistribution mechanisms typically managed by governments. Consequently, these developers struggle to receive the financial rewards they deserve.
 
 Imagine a future where Gitcoin is seamlessly integrated with social media: developers of OSS and public goods can use ggframe to encourage users to donate without leaving their social media platforms. 
 
 Users simply discover ggframe, enter their donation amount, click a button, and complete their donation, significantly improving the user experience (UX).
 
 Currently, platforms like Twitter are used for promoting donations. With ggframe, donations can be solicited directly on social media channels.
 
 ggframe allows users to donate directly to Gitcoin Grants on Farcaster-supported chains such as Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism without leaving the app. Originally, users had to donate through explore.gitcoin.co, but ggframe directly interacts with the [Allo V2 contract](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2) used by Gitcoin Grants, ensuring secure and easy donations!
 
 ## Our Roadmap
 ggframe will operate as Open Source Software (OSS) and a public good to further encourage funding for public goods. By leveraging the Gitcoin platform, our goal is to facilitate the funding of millions to tens of millions of dollars for OSS and public goods through ggframe in the future.

 *Standardizing EVM Address Labeling for Enhanced Blockchain Transparency*
 
 **Website**: [Open Labels Initiative](https://github.com/openlabelsinitiative/OLI) 
 **Founded by:** growthepie & walletlabels. 
 
 ---
 
 ### About Open Labels Initiative üìö 
 The **Open Labels Initiative (OLI)** is a community-driven project aimed at addressing the fragmentation and non-standardization of blockchain labels across the Ethereum ecosystem. OLI introduces an open, community-owned data model for consistent and scalable smart contract labeling, enabling better interoperability between data teams and projects.
 
 By creating a unified labeling framework, OLI ensures that blockchain addresses ‚Äî whether smart contracts or externally owned accounts (EOAs) ‚Äî are uniformly tagged, providing deeper insights into blockchain activity and reducing duplicate efforts across data teams.
 
 ---
 
 ### OLI Framework üîß 
 
 The OLI framework provides a flexible, community-managed structure that works by assigning unique `tag_id`s to given addresses. 
 These `tag_id`s can represent anything from simple True/False values to specific sets of values, which can be further defined in the OLI GitHub repository. 
 This makes the framework easily adoptable by any data team, streamlining labeling efforts across the blockchain data ecosystem.
 
 Each label includes:
 - **Address:** The unique hexadecimal address of the smart contract or EOA.
 - **Chain ID:** The unique identifier of the blockchain where the address is deployed (e.g., for Ethereum = 1).
 - **Tag ID:** A pre-defined identifier that specifies the type of value associated with it (e.g., is_eoa).
 - **Value:** The specific data or context relevant to the assigned tag ID (True/False).

 ### Current Features üíª 
 
 - **Collaborative Dataset Sharing:** OLI enables teams to share their labeling datasets easily. Each dataset follows the OLI framework, ensuring interoperability between data sources.
 - **Open Source Tools:** Teams are encouraged to use the OLI-compliant data model for address labeling. Tools like growthepie's [Smart Contract Explorer](https://labels.growthepie.xyz/) and walletlabels' [EOA Labeling Platform](https://walletlabels.xyz) showcase OLI in action.
 - **Tagging with Community Input:** Anyone can contribute new `tag_ids` or refine existing ones, helping the ecosystem stay updated with new developments.
 
 ---
 
 ### Roadmap üìÖ 
 - **Permissionless Data Entry**: We are building a custom resolver contract using the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) to allow anyone to attest smart contract labels onchain, creating a registry of labels on each chain. This approach aims to crowdsource labels and enable deployers to directly attest their labels with onchain proof, allowing all data teams across the ecosystem to seamlessly and neutrally sync the labels.
 - **Council Formation**: Establishing a neutral council to manage the addition of new tags and revisions to the framework.
 - **Community Labeling Rewards**: We plan to incentivize community members by offering monetary rewards based on the reliability and quantity of their contributed labels. Contributors will receive scores based on the accuracy and volume of their labels, encouraging quality and active participation.

Co-create, attest, and own your collaboration graph, forever.
 
 ## Open to the Public (OTTP) is on a mission to democratize innovation.
 
 
 ## Problem
 
 Your work contributions are siloed in various projects, self-reported and unverified, and locked into closed platforms like LinkedIn and GitHub.
 
 ![Current State to Future State](https://i.imgur.com/ktAPsPf.png)
 
 
 ## Solution
 
 You own verified records of what you‚Äôve done and who you collaborated with.
 
 Contributions are recognized and provable, verified by collaborators via onchain attestations, and self-custodial, meaning your collaboration graph can move freely between apps/clients.
 
 ## How It Works
 
 OTTP protocol design using onchain attestations:
 - **Subjects:** identities who take actions
 - **Objects:** containers created by subjects
 - **Blocks:** object subcomponents created by subjects
 - **Links:** verified connections between subjects and objects
 
 ![OTTP subjects and objects](https://i.imgur.com/SS7f4jJ.png)
 
 Any subject (individual or team) can create an object. To start, there are four object types: Project, Proposal, Milestone, and Contribution. Blocks are subcomponents that can point to onchain or off-chain data (files, images, links, etc.). Every link (connection) between subjects and/or objects can be verified by an onchain attestation.
 
 ![OTTP subjects, objects, and blocks example](https://i.imgur.com/WZdGMiV.png)
 
 See our [website](https://opentothepublic.org) or [docs](https://docs.opentothepublic.org) for more information about the protocol. View the [user flow here](https://www.figma.com/board/0OM3ythk8oWeehhLonKYc8/OTTP-user-flow?node-id=1-45&t=JNgFhLWZNrMEiMuW-1).
 
 
 ## Web client
 
 To demo the protocol, we‚Äôre developing an open-source web client built on OTTP. It will demonstrate how users can easily find collaborators, contribute to projects, and put their work conchain.
 
 Check out the video below of the [Figma prototype](https://bit.ly/ottp-web-client-v0-prototype) or explore it yourself.
 
 [![OTTP web client ‚Äî v0 prototype](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Qgb6xj09eks/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Qgb6xj09eks)
 
 The OTTP front-end will include the basic core features, with a less opinionated structure, which allows different builders to customize it and create clients focused around certain communities or audience segments (DAOs, fractional workers, etc.).
 
 We are raising funds for the continued development of the open protocol, including an updated SDK. We will use 100% of the funds for development, mostly in the form of public bounties.
 
 
 ## Progress
 
 This year, we went from zero to live protocol during Backdrop Build V3, and we were selected as V3 and V4 finalists.
 
 Since the [last Gitcoin OSS round](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/26/78), we created a developer SDK, which has received 1K+ downloads to date. We are preparing to deploy the updated version of our smart contract with additional core features, and have created the initial designs for our open-source front-end.
 
 Core Features:
 - OTTP ID creation
 - ORG ID creation
 - Sign in with Farcaster ID (FID)
 - Sign in with Ethereum address
 - User and organization profiles 
 - Project pages
 - Proposals
 - Milestones
 - Contribution attestations
 
 Other core protocol features that may be implemented into the web client in the future and available to all builders via the OTTP SDK.
 
 - Sign in with other methods, e.g. email, Lens, etc.

GG22,ENS Ecosystem,Plebbit,0x5Bc4FF33f86E0272be53Fa25861294489AB2FE2a,https://twitter.com/getplebbit,https://github.com/plebbit,Plebbit,https://plebbit.com,APPROVED,"Plebbit is a protocol and tooling for creating decentralized forum applications like Reddit, Facebook groups, Discourse, etc. It's a pure P2P protocol, it doesn't use any central server, databases, public HTTP end point, DNS, etc. It uses parts of the IPFS and Ethereum stack to create everything it needs:
 
 IPFS for immutable data, like a published comment or a recent subplebbit page.
 
 IPNS for mutable data, like replies to a comment, upvote counts, new posts/comments published on a subplebbit, etc.
 
 IPFS pubsub for authors publishing comments/votes to a subplebbit and for the captcha challenge exchange between authors and subplebbits.
 
 ENS for usernames, community names, and serving the client in browsers.
 
 Scalability and fees
 
 A decentralized social media/forum has 2 problems: How to store the entire world's data on a blockchain, and how to prevent spam while being feeless. We propose solving the data problem by not using a blockchain for content, but rather IPNS and IPFS pubsub. Unlike cryptocurrencies that must know the order of each transaction to prevent double spends, social media does not care about the order of posts, nor about the availability of old posts.
 
 Note that we must still use a blockchain (ENS) for usernames and community names because those do care about doublespends and ledger history availability.
 
 IPNS
 
 The IPNS name (also ENS name) is the name and address of the subplebbit, e.g. ""memes.eth"".
 
 Pubsub
 
 To publish a post to a subplebbit, a user would publish a pubsub message with a ""topic"" equal to the subplebbit's ENS name. This allows the subplebbit owner to reply with ""challenge"" and ""challengeverification"" messages signed with his ENS' public key that all pubsub peers can verify.
 
 Captcha service over pubsub
 
 Nondeterministic pubsub (like user generated comments) is susceptible to spam attacks that would DDOS it, as well as makes it impossible for moderators to manually moderate an infinite amount of bot spam. We solve this problem by requiring publishers to first request a captcha challenge from the subplebbit owner's peer. If a peer or IP address relays too many captcha challenge requests without providing enough correct captcha challenge answers, it gets blocked from the pubsub. This requires the subplebbit owner's peer to broadcast the result of all captcha challenge answers, and for each peer to keep this information for some time.
 
 Note: The challenge implementation is completely up to the subplebbit owner. He can decide to prompt all users, first time users only, or no users at all. He can proxy 3rd party services like Google captchas. He can use other challenge types, like a proof of stake/holding/payment of a certain token, a whitelist, invite list, etc.
 
 Lifecycle of creating a subplebbit
 
 Subplebbit owner starts a Plebbit client ""node"" on his desktop or server. It must be always online to serve content to his users.
 
 He generates an IPNS public key, and adds it as a TXT record to his ENS name, which will be the ""address"" of his subplebbit.
 
 He configures captcha options, like how often and what kind of captchas to show.
 
 He publishes the metadata of his subplebbit to his IPNS record. This includes subpebblit title, description, rules, list of public keys of moderators, etc.
 
 Lifecycle of reading the latest posts on a subplebbit
 
 User opens the Plebbit app in a browser or desktop client, and sees an interface similar to Reddit.
 
 His client joins the public key addressing network as a peer and makes a DHT query for each address of each subplebbit he is a member of. The queries each take several seconds but can be performed concurrently.
 
 The query returns the latest posts of each subplebbit, as well as their metadata such as title, description, moderator list and captcha server URL.
 
 His client arranges the content received in an interface similar to Reddit.
 
 Lifecycle of publishing a post on a subplebbit
 
 User opens the Plebbit app in a browser or desktop client, and sees an interface similar to Reddit.
 
 The app automatically generates a public key pair if the user doesn't already have one.
 
 He publishes a cat post for a subplebbit called ""cats.eth""
 
 His client joins the pubsub network for ""cats.eth""
 
 His client makes a request for a captcha challenge over pubsub.
 
 His client receives a captcha challenge over pubsub (relayed from the subplebbit owner's peer).
 
 The app displays the captcha challenge to the user in an iframe.
 
 The user completes the captcha challenge and publishes his post and captcha challenge answer over pubsub.
 
 The subplebbit owner's client gets notified that the user published to his pubsub, the post is not ignored because it contains a correct captcha challenge answer.
 
 The subplebbit owner's client publishes a message over pubsub indicating that the captcha answer is correct or incorrect. Peers relaying too many messages with incorrect or no captcha answers get blocked to avoid DDOS of the pubsub.
 
 The subplebbit owner's client updates the content of his subplebbit's public key based addressing automatically.
 
 A few minutes later, each user reading the subplebbit receives the update in their app.
 
 If the user's post violates the subplebbit's rules, a moderator can delete it, using a similar process the user used to publish.
 
 What is a ""post""
 
 A post is an IPFS file for its immutable content, like timestamp, title, author signature, etc. Each post's IPFS file also contains its own IPNS name which links to its mutable content, like its upvote count, replies, etc. Each post is part of a linked list, i.e. it points to the previous post's IPFS CID.
 
 What is a ""subplebbit""
 
 A subplebbit is an IPNS record updated every 5 minutes, it contains the latest post's CID, the title, description, the CIDs of the latest post pages sorted by new, hot, top, etc. It also contains the pubsub ""topic"" address to publish to it. Full schema available at https://github.com/plebbit/plebbit-js#schema
 
 Using anti-spam strategies other than the captcha service
 
 The captcha service can be replaced by other ""anti-spam strategies"", such proof of balance of a certain cryptocurrency. For example, a subplebbit owner might require that posts be signed by users holding at least 1 ETH, or at least 1 token of his choice. Another strategy could be a proof of payment, each post must be accompanied by a minimum payment to the owner of the subplebbit. This might be fitting for celebrities wanting to use their subplebbit as a form of ""onlyfan"", where fans pay to interact with them. Both these scenarios would not eliminate spam, but they would bring them down from an infinite amount of spam, to an amount that does not overwhelm the pubsub, and that a group of human moderators can manage. Proof of balance/payment are deterministic so the pubsub can block spam attacks deterministically. Even more strategies can be added to fit the need of different communities if found, but at this time the captcha service remains the most versatile strategy.
 
 Conclusion
 
 We believe that the design above would solve the problems of a serverless, adminless decentralized Reddit alternative. It would allow unlimited amounts of subplebbits, users, posts, comments and votes. This is achieved by not caring about the order or availability of old data. It would allow users to post for free using an identical Reddit interface. It would allow subplebbit owners to moderate spam semi-automatically using their own captcha service over peer-to-peer pubsub. It would allow for all features that make Reddit addictive: upvotes, replies, notifications, awards, and a chance to make the ""front page"". Finally, it would allow the Plebbit client developers to serve an unlimited amount of users, without any server, legal, advertising or moderation infrastructure.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/642/53

 As the CEO of Green Digital Guardians, I lead a project dedicated to forest conservation, leveraging technology to protect biodiversity globally. I have also been involved in the blockchain and decentralized finance space, where I explore how these technologies can be applied to agriculture and environmental conservation. Through my work, I have actively contributed to the research and development of systems aimed at combating deforestation and preserving ecosystems.
 
 ##### Education and Growth
 I am the founder of ReFi Medell√≠n, a local node within the ReFiDAO network. ReFi Medell√≠n was the first local node in the ReFi Local Nodes competition and played a pivotal role in creating similar nodes in Colombia‚Äôs major regions. These initiatives have fostered the growth of local communities and created inclusive opportunities for economic empowerment through decentralized technologies. My work in public speaking‚Äîat events such as Blockchain Summit Latam and ReFiGathering Spain‚Äîfurther emphasizes my commitment to educating others about the transformative potential of Web3 technologies.
 
 ##### Operational Support and Governance
 I serve as a Celo Governance Guardian, where I actively contribute to Celo‚Äôs governance initiatives, supporting decentralized decision-making. I have played key roles in governance processes for organizations such as Celo EuropeDAO, Celo KoreaDAO, Celo LatamDAO, and many others. Additionally, I manage Celo Guilds across platforms like Discord, Reddit, and Telegram, providing operational support to nurture community growth.
 
 ##### Impact on Local Communities and Bioregions
 Through ReFi Medell√≠n and the broader ReFiColombia ecosystem, I have made significant contributions to local communities by driving projects that address social, economic, and environmental regeneration. These initiatives aim to promote sustainable growth by merging local ecological solutions with blockchain technology. I‚Äôve also supported various global ReFi initiatives, contributing to the growth and strengthening of regenerative movements worldwide.
 
 #### Commitment to the Regen Movement
 My work is driven by a deep belief in the power of decentralized technologies to solve real-world challenges, from environmental sustainability to inclusive economic development. By continuously working on projects that integrate regenerative finance with tangible impacts on communities and ecosystems, I strive to advance the vision of a thriving regenerative economy.

With Distributed Press, you can effortlessly publish and host content across multiple distributed networks and peer-to-peer (P2P) protocols, including IPFS, ActivityPub, BitTorrent, and Hypercore. We are exploring adding new protocols in the coming months. 
 
 This innovative tool enhances any Content Management System (CMS) by integrating P2P and decentralized protocols for efficient content distribution and archiving. We also offer a suite of tools for interacting with the Fediverse via ActivityPub.
 
 Building on our deep protocol expertise we want to tackle the issue of decentralized or uncensorable frontends to offer users a fully decentralized stack. Right now, DeFi apps struggle to securely distribute their frontends to users without compromising the nice, easy to use Web2 experience. We will work on improving our SDK and tooling as well as publish some example frontends to enable developers to more easily create and distribute their data. 
 
 Why does this matter? By combining distributed web protocols with uncensorable front ends, Distributed Press offers significant benefits:
 
 - Self-Sovereign Content: Maintain control over your content and ensure it remains accessible across the decentralized web.
 - Resilience: Reduce link rot and avoid 404 errors with robust distributed web technology.
 - Censorship Resistance: Bypass censorship and make your content accessible to a global audience.
 - Broaden User Reach: Seamlessly connect with a global network of decentralized websites, potentially increasing engagement.
 - Overcome Connectivity Issues: Connect with audiences in areas with limited internet access through efficient P2P discovery and localized storage solutions.

 # Regenerative R&D Since 2009
 
 As a co-founder of [BloomNetwork.earth](https://bloomnetwork.earth), I've guided our community to develop a social network that prioritizes **local empowerment** and increases **public participation** in constructive solutions. 
 
 * Facilitated an extensive dialogue and healing process with Bloom's global organizers in over 30 countries, to design a system **resilient to the power abuses prevalent in dominant financial and governance structures.**
 
 * Co-wrote Bloom's [**open source federated governance model**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xZFoS7EHlmPfnAKAOHdbK0FTHBMSrItO/view?usp=drive_link) for community-owned infrastructure, including sectors like technology, food, energy, and housing. 
 
 * Engineered Bloom's **Regenerative Economic Protocol**. It leapfrogs the investment gap to establishing lasting, **place-based regenerative economies at both bioregional and global levels.** I obtained several certifications in platform cooperatives and economics to invent it, and I'm unbelievably happy to say that it's working!!
 
 * Ran our first **Local Action Rewards** funding round, incentivizing **[75+ impact reports](https://bloomnetwork.earth/communityposts)** from local organizers worldwide, distributing **$15,000**. I built integrations with [Inverter Network](https://www.inverter.network/), [Capsule Wallet](https://www.usecapsule.com/), and [Karma GAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/), to make **Web3 participation accessible** to non-technical users, while streamlining reporting labor for grassroots leaders and increasing their visibility for grants. Last month **I onboarded over 100 local impact doers to Web3 for the first time** through our novel approach to retroactive public goods funding.
 
 # Education and Growth: 
 
 I have provided thousands of hours of business development guidance to cooperatives, venture studios, ecovillages, and other initiatives. This support has played a crucial role in establishing **five stable regional regenerative economies in Uganda, the US, Mexico, Costa Rica, and Brazil.**
 
 I played ""human switchboard"", sharing Local nodes' innovations with each other between the time our previous CEO suddenly took our social network down in 2012, and 2022. Our platform now facilitates direct **peer-to-peer education across diverse issue areas** our nodes have prototyped successful solutions in.
 
 To start this journey, I trained for three years with Radical Women in **women‚Äôs leadership and decentralized governance.** I apply these principles to building decentralized finance tools, including a grants tool for the Ethereum Foundation. 
 
 
 # Operational Support 
 
 I've contributed:
 
 * **Capacity Building**: business development, grant writing, and communications for Local Organizers.
 * **Team Coordination**: Led teams of dozens of professionals ([Join us!](https://bloomnetwork.earth/bloomers-without-borders)) to develop a community-designed social platform. 
 * **Platform Build**: I upskilled to do our frontend development and graphic design. I also do our accounting, which has been useful in helping Local networks understand how to onboard to Web3.
 * **Revenue Sustainability**: Positioned Bloom Network to become revenue-positive given, hopefully soon, strategic capital investment.
 
 The cohesive operational support we‚Äôve established as a global collective has enabled Bloom to be **a driving force in the regenerative and bioregional movements for over 16 years.**

 # Impact on Local Communities and Bioregions
 
 My event production and local contributions have **catalyzed 3 global movements** alongside Bloom. I've been a local community organizer for 25 years. In the San Francisco Bay Area, I fostered collaboration between artists, activists, and technologists through events series like **HiveMind**, which blended elements of a hackathon, festival, and church.
 
 * Facilitated connections that led to the [**successful decriminalization of plant-based entheogens**](https://www.decriminalizenature.org/) **in 10 cities**, with over 100 cities engaging in similar policy efforts.
 * **Regen-Pilled Benjamin Life** , who went on to start [OpenCivics](https://opencivics.substack.com/about).

 we are building on-chain firewalls
 What is an On-Chain Smart Contract Firewall?
 Smart contract hacks have been plaguing DeFi protocols, bridges, and more.
 
 Today, in order to defend themselves, protocols perform audits, open bug bounties, and implement monitoring.
 
 All of these steps are absolutely crucial. Nevertheless, whenever a vulnerability is discovered by an attacker, most exploits can drain funds in a very short period of time, sometimes even within a single transaction. To prevent these hacks from happening, we need an on-chain tool.
 
 You can think of the Smart Contract Firewall as an additional layer of security for DeFi protocols.
 
 Our Firewall is a set of Solidity Smart Contracts that allow you to:
 
 Define critical parameters for your protocol (e.g., TVL) and track these parameters over time.
 
 Detect that a transaction (or multiple) is causing the protocol to operate outside its normal activity (e.g., unusual liquidity outflow, indicative of a potential hack happening).
 
 Implement a set of protective measures, including transaction blocking, protocol pausing, fund freezing, or controlled fund withdrawal, before the transaction is committed and funds exit the protocol.
 
 The Firewall provides a way to detect abnormal changes in your protocol directly on-chain, that could be indicative of a hack. That means that you can act upon abnormal activity, whenever it occurs, directly on the blockchain.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/610/56

 My name is Anna, I am from Croatia but I currently live in M√©xico! I‚Äôve been in the blockchain-for-good space since January 2021, contributing to projects like Proof of Humanity, Crypto Commons Association, MetaGame, ReFi Spring and ReFi DAO, and most recently General Magic. During this time, I‚Äôve had the privilege of contributing to the regenerative finance movement in meaningful ways, helping projects and individuals grow, learn, and connect within the space.
 
 Today, I am applying for the Gitcoin Citizens Round to gain support for my ongoing contributions space. Here is what I‚Äôve done in the past. üëá
 
 **My Contributions to ReFi DAO üåéüåçüåè**
 
 ![contributions](https://skilled-lime-cow.myfilebase.com/ipfs/QmeEsU2GLWrpuMXRMiMZpyz6nnhkcKYR6L9RbM8HHCc8Hg)
 
 During my journey at ReFi DAO from January 2023 to May 2024, I‚Äôve immersed myself in a range of activities and initiatives that align with the vision of creating a regenerative future. My focus has been on fostering community engagement, providing communication support, and helping teams and projects navigate Gitcoin and other Web3 opportunities. Here are some of the key contributions I‚Äôve made so far:
 
 
 - **Local Nodes Alpha Cohort:** Together with Daryl Edwards, I co-coordinated the Local Nodes Alpha Cohort, a learning and growth initiative for Local Node founders. This cohort provided founders with the necessary tools and knowledge to successfully fundraise through Gitcoin, and we saw great engagement and progress from the participants.
 
 - **Gitcoin Grants 18:** I also played a key role in supporting 31 Local Nodes to join the Local Node Featured Round during Gitcoin Grants 18, providing guidance and operational support to ensure their successful onboarding.
 
 - **Local Node Onboarding:** I played a pivotal role in the onboarding of 14 projects to the Local Node Featured Round during Gitcoin‚Äôs Beta Round. I worked closely with project leads, guiding them through the application process and ensuring that they had the resources and information necessary to succeed.
 
 **Expanding My Efforts üåø**
 
 In 2024, I‚Äôve taken on new responsibilities and further expanded my contributions to the ReFi ecosystem. These recent efforts have allowed me to deepen my engagement with the community and support more projects across a broader range of activities:
 
 - **ReFi DAO Local Node Cohort 2:** I co-organized the Local Node Cohort 2 alongside Monty Briant and Scott Morris. This cohort offered a comprehensive program designed to support Local Node founders with everything from fundraising strategies to building strong community ties.
 
  - We hosted 13 sessions that included over 20 hours of instructional content and exercises.
  - 100+ participants attended, with over 25 tuning in consistently each week to learn and grow together.
  - We were joined by more than a dozen guest speakers who shared insights on various topics, including on-chain finance and local organizing strategies.
  - I helped mint and issue 182 POAPs to verified attendees as a token of appreciation for their participation.
 - We also created 18 Local Node Profile pages, including 12 for newly incubated nodes, offering a template for future nodes to build their profiles.
 
 **ReFi Podcast - Season 3:** Working alongside John Ellison, I was responsible for the marketing and communications for ReFi Podcast Season 3. I promoted the episodes via newsletters and social media, ensuring the podcast reached a wide audience within the ReFi community.
 
 - **ReFi Roundup:** I‚Äôve been involved in the writing and editing of multiple ReFi Roundup articles, which serve as a key communication tool for the community. These roundups offer valuable insights into the latest developments in the regenerative finance space, and I‚Äôm proud to have played a part in shaping the content and messaging for our readers.
 
 - **ETH Global - Volunteering:** I‚Äôve also had the pleasure of volunteering at several ETH Global events in London, Brussels, and San Francisco. These events provided me the opportunity to help hackers and builders working on cutting-edge technology have the best possible experience, ensuring they had the support they needed to bring their visions to life.
 
 **Where I Am Now: Exciting New Ventures üöÄ**
 
 ![Ventures](https://skilled-lime-cow.myfilebase.com/ipfs/QmWutPwRTGMBBzUnwJU3XKyizZMd9CARhWha7eMPWJDfK7)
 
 Looking forward, I have several exciting projects and responsibilities on the horizon:
 
 - ReFi Latam Local Node: I‚Äôve recently started coordinating the operations of the ReFi Latam Local Node, an initiative that aims to provide a support network for Local Nodes across Latin America. Although it‚Äôs in the early stages, I‚Äôm confident it will grow into a vital resource for the region‚Äôs regenerative projects.
 
 - Regen Side Event in Bangkok: I am in the process of organizing a regen side event in Bangkok, Thailand, which will bring together local and international regenerative builders for discussions and collaborations. This event promises to be an exciting opportunity to network and explore innovative regenerative solutions. Stay tuned for more details coming soon!
 
 - General Magic - Grants Manager: I‚Äôm currently contributing as a Grants Manager at General Magic, where I help regenerative projects secure the funding they need to continue their important work. I‚Äôm particularly passionate about helping these projects navigate complex grant processes and find the resources they need to thrive.
 
 **Public Speaking Experience üé§**
 
 ![speaking](https://skilled-lime-cow.myfilebase.com/ipfs/QmTr61LrMebiouuCovvip6xmmU7KUw9cm5bCkWyAgQeGSS)
 
 In addition to my work in social media, communications, and community-building, I have developed significant public speaking experience. I‚Äôve had the opportunity to share insights at several events, both in-person and virtually, where I‚Äôve spoken about the importance of regenerative finance, decentralized systems, and community-driven change.

NFTs visualize and evaluate individual contributions, creating a generationally inheritable system. It aims to form new communities beyond geographical boundaries through autonomous governance and scalable design.
 
 Yohaku is a project to promote community contribution activities using cutting-edge decentralized technologies, born from the terraced rice paddy restoration efforts in the Ueyama area of Mimasaka City, Okayama Prefecture. The Ueyama area is a beautiful ""satoyama"" with about 8,300 terraced rice paddies, but due to depopulation and aging, the number of abandoned farmland is increasing, making it difficult to maintain the terraced rice paddies that boast a thousand years of history. Furthermore, it is a region where the issues faced by rural Japan, such as cultural inheritance, town maintenance, lack of successors, and the dilution of local communities, are concentrated. Yohaku uses blockchain technology to solve these regional issues, increasing the number of people who support the region and providing a mechanism to properly evaluate their contributions.
 
 Specifically, Yohaku NFT will be issued to new participants, and the reporting of contribution activities will be reflected in EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service). Users who have made a certain contribution will be issued an NFT to prove it, and will be able to manage it with TBA (Token Bound Account). The four main features of Yohaku are ""self-governance,"" ""scalability,"" ""succession,"" and ""outcome-oriented."" We believe that the future of the region should be decided by the people involved in the region, that digital technology can overcome geographical and community constraints, that the contributions of each individual can be passed on to the next generation, and that concrete results should be evaluated. In particular, the ""succession"" mechanism allows the accumulation of contributions to be passed on to the next bearer with the approval of multiple users when the current holder is unable to continue regional activities due to circumstances, enabling community contributions across generations. Yohaku will first conduct a demonstration experiment in the Ueyama area through NFT distribution challenges and actual regional activities, and then expand the model to other areas. In the future, we will promote collaboration with other regions facing similar issues by making it open source. Yohaku is an ambitious project that challenges regional issues and sustainable community building with the power of decentralized technology. The new approach, which is based on the spontaneous activities of local people while supporting them with digital technology and fostering them as an ""unstoppable infrastructure"" across generations, may become a model case for regional revitalization in Japan.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/608/57

 ## About
 I am Cecilia Contreras, aka Ceci Sakura, started my journey in the regenerative space through apiculture, which opened my eyes to the bigger picture of sustainability and regeneration. From there, I‚Äôve dived into using regenerative finance (ReFi) and blockchain technology to help drive local conservation projects in Bolivia. My focus has always been on collaboration, supporting impactful initiatives, and creating long-term change.
 
 One community that played a key role in opening up a world of endless possibilities for me is Let‚Äôs Grow DAO. Through their continuous Let‚Äôs Grow Live spaces during GG19, I had the opportunity to present Wild Friends, a project that was just starting to operate, using NFTs as access keys to fund Senda Verde, an animal rescue refuge. This connection allowed me to link up with other projects and learn from diverse ReFi experiences around the world. I‚Äôm incredibly grateful to Let‚Äôs Grow DAO for giving me this global platform, aligned with solarpunk values and philosophy, and for the ongoing opportunities for growth and connection.
 
 
 Heres is a brief summary of the key areas of impact I had:
 - **Regenerative R&D**: 
 As the Community Manager for Wild Friends, a Bolivian Web3 project, I played a key role in its growth and connection with the ReFi space. I led efforts to enhance the player experience and foster engagement by building a community around the project. During the La Paz International Book Fair 2023, I coordinated initiatives between Wild Friends and Senda Verde, enrolling over 150 player testers into our testing program. This collaboration helped improve the game based on community feedback while highlighting the real-world impact of the project, which supports Senda Verde‚Äôs animal refuge through NFTs as access keys. My work helped bridge gaming and regenerative finance, positioning Wild Friends as a unique Web3 project.

 ![Ceci- WF-UPB2](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hkt0EGLx1g.jpg)
 
 
 - **Education and Growth**: 
 I‚Äôm part of the Ethereum Bolivia core team, where I volunteer to organize meetups, events, hackathons/buildathons and initiatives aimed at educating the local community about blockchain and Web3. My goal is to create opportunities for people to understand these technologies and how they can be used to address economic challenges, especially now that Bolivia‚Äôs restrictions on crypto have been lifted.
 I led the organization of the first ETH Bolivia 2023 Hackathon where there were 3 ReFi projects developed, 1 becoming a 2nd place winner ""Uma Irpiri"" in the Local Solutions category.

 ![1718898485364](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyWGBfUl1x.jpg)
 
 
 - **Operational Support**: 
 As co-founder of ReFi Bolivia, I not only designed the marketing strategy for Senda Verde Wildlife Refuge during Gitcoin GG20 but also developed and submitted their project application for three funding rounds, all of which were successfully accepted. This effort helped secure vital resources for their Passiflora conservation initiative. I also coordinated Vicky Ossio's participation in Let‚Äôs Grow Live spaces, where she raised awareness about the challenges facing Bolivia's National Forest Reserves. Additionally, I created their Karma Gap profile, which continues to track and update their progress.

 Also I support the RegenLearnings.xyz community calls as note taker, contributing those through Github.
 
 
 - **Impact on Local Communities and Bioregions**: 
 Through Passiflora, located in the Madidi Reserve, I‚Äôve contributed to creating a safe space for wildlife and promoting eco-tourism. This project is about more than just conservation‚Äîit provides economic opportunities for nearby communities while focusing on preserving the Amazon‚Äôs biodiversity.

Leveraging EAS & existing reputation groups (e.g. delegates, badgeholders, passport, etc), we make it easy to build & verify reputation for projects in the web3 space. Our goal is to provide simple, ready made, and interoperable infrastructure for communities that need to validate the reputation of projects receiving funds. Our front end is merely a reference implementation and the backend infra is built to be extensible and easily integrated into any other front end.
 
 DeVouch is a system for members of reputable organizations in the Ethereum ecosystem to vouch for projects that are looking to raise funding. By vouching for a project, the organization can lend its credibility to the project, building confidence for those looking to support it with funding.
 
 DeVouch collects projects from Optimism‚Äôs Retro Funding, Gitcoin and Giveth, presenting them in a single place allowing users to either vouch or flag for a project (*more platforms may be added in the future.)
 
 Visitors to the website can see the vouches and flags received by each project, tracked by the ""Attester Group"" that the vouch or flag came from. Attester Groups are simply recipients of attestations on EAS. Examples are OP Badgeholders and Gitcoin Passport holders. Anyone can create an attestation and add it to DeVouch.

 The engagement metrics are pulled from onchain and offchain data sources.
 
 For instance:
 1 point for 1 transaction on Ethereum.
 5 points for 1 post on Twitter that contains the hashtag or mentions: #ethereum/@ethereum.
 5 points for 1 post on Warpcast that contains the hashtag, mentions, or was posted in a particular channel: #ethereum/@ethereum//ethereum.
 5 points for 1 badge on Talent Protocol.
 
 The application is meant to gamify the data and foster a sense of achievement; rewarding users with a feeling of accomplishment for their activities and participation within a blockchain's ecosystem. Although it is meant to track a user's engagement, it can also amplify their engagement within an ecosystem. The feeling of achievement may make them participate more within their community through creating more onchain transactions, twitter posts, casts, or by using other tooling in their ecosystem. There is currently no onchain incentive as that is not the heart of the application (although something like that may be implemented at some point, provided it maintains the core values of the application. Money or speculative assets are not a core value of the application).
 
 Any EVM blockchain is supported, provided they are properly configured within the app.
 The code is completely open source and built in a way where owners of a blockchain may make a Pull Request to change the layout, color schemes, and data sources for their particular pages. Alongside that, providing developers in the community to opportunity to make improvements, bug fixes, and new ideas to the application.
 
 It aims to push Onchain social protocols forward by implementing ENS, Basename, and other similar protocols. Providing a single profile across the entire blockchain ecosystem.
 
 It upholds the values of transparency by being completely open-sourced with every data source being traced back to its source as possible and decentralization by using the most decentralized tooling possible.
 
 Publics Goods may not be a good match for this application. In that case, we may experiment with a monthly Onchain SaaS model to support operations.

Foundry is great speed-wise but writing tests in Solidity is a disaster and the command-line interface is bad for complex operations. Hardhat is slow, has way too much boilerplate, interacts poorly with modern ESM. Both projects are very ""do it our way"". The result is that many contracts don't have tests, and the tests that exist aren't end-to-end. 
 
 OTOH, blocksmith.js is simple. It gives you a lightweight wrapper around `forge` and `anvil`, so you can script Foundry however you want. You can use any async JS testing framework, including the default nodejs test runner, or just write simple JS scripts that glue anything you want together. 
 
 To properly test an ENS contract with CCIP-Read, you need to deploy a lot of infrastructure: a registry, a resolver, some names, a CCIP-server, and then test all of the interactions. blocksmith.js makes this trivial.
 
 At the moment, you can `npm i @adraffy/blocksmith`. I'd like to write tests for more contracts to illustrate how to use blocksmith. This is also an useful learning experience as I get to figure out what features I'm missing or what needs improved. This should expand the feature set and improve ergonomics. 
 
 I'd like to explore making end-to-end tests for cross-chain communication so developers can locally simulate things like EVM gateway and other ideas. Running parallel testnets is blocksmith.js is effortless and I see a lot of value in cross-chain tests that can be described in a single JS file.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/609/59

 ### Introduction to PORTERS
 
 PORTERS is a developer-centric RPC gateway that offers fast and easy access to blockchain functionalities. PORTERS simplifies the creation and management of RPC endpoints for blockchain applications, allowing developers to focus on innovation without the hassle of backend complexities. PORTERS leverages the POKT Network's extensive node infrastructure, consisting of thousands of nodes globally, to provide its RPC services.
 
 ### Mission
 
 PORTERS aims to lower the barrier to entry for blockchain development by providing a user-friendly interface and comprehensive documentation. This approach enables even those with minimal blockchain experience to implement complex functionalities. 
 
 By exposing a decentralised RPC service layer for providing seamless access, PORTERS enhances privacy, reduces single points of failure, and provides a more resilient infrastructure for blockchain applications.
 
 We are the exception by offering Web3-native payments, enabling users to swap their crypto directly to pay for RPC relays without the need to use a credit card.

 ### Progress Since Gitcoin Grant Round 20
 
 Since the last Gitcoin Round, the PORTERS platform was officially launched in early June 2024.
 
 We have been actively acquiring new users, including public goods projects, and forming partnerships.
 
 On the technical side, we have been working on several features, including:
 
 1. Integration with additional blockchain networks.
 - Together with our partners at Taiko we are now one of very few providers of a free public endpoint that is not rate limited. In the future, we would like to explore how this could benefit other ecosystems as well.
 2. Development of a decentralised data API. 
 3. Improving the Swap/Redeem UI.
 
 Additionally, we are currently onboarding several projects that are going to use our RPC services and improve the user experience based on the feedback received during the onboarding process.

 The Problems with existing social media
 
 
 There are a lot of social media platforms out there, and we should agree they provided us great service, but also we should agree there are a lot of problems still persists.
 
 
 
 ‚Ä¢ Personal Information: We need to give a lot of personal information not needed for the platform or useful for consumers.
 
 ‚Ä¢ Privacy: There is no privacy on the existing platforms. All the data we give are sold for advertisements, and 1000s of mods and admins monitor all our posts and chats.
 
 ‚Ä¢ Spam: Current model creates tons of spam against the user. Because spamming is free, you don't need to pay money to spam.
 
 ‚Ä¢ Downtime: The app we use right now is prone to downtime because a single company with limited servers hosts that.
 
 
 
 The Problems Hey Solves
 
 
 ‚Ä¢ Personal Information: You don't provide any personal information except your username (it's your choice) and wallet address, and we don't collect any sensitive information, and it's difficult to store those in Smart contracts.
 
 ‚Ä¢ Privacy: Hey or the Lens team doesn't have access to remove your posts, everything you post is public, and you are responsible for it.
 
 ‚Ä¢ Spam: In Hey, you must sign for everything or by the relay. That's the nature of the Blockchain; no one wants to sign their identity for spamming
 
 ‚Ä¢ Downtime: Hey is hosted in a decentralized chain and decentralized file storage system IPFS. This means there will be 0 downtimes, and no one can DDoS the platform.

 ![Zenbit Badges Main Screen](https://github.com/zenbitETH/Public-Assets/blob/main/Zenbit%20Badges/zb4.png?raw=true)
 
 ## Problem
 
 The Web3 environment presents significant challenges for both newcomers and existing community members due to its complexity and steep learning curve. Core issues include a lack of standardized, accessible, and easy-to-understand educational resources for the average user. In addition, the user experience can be difficult to navigate, with unclear pathways for skill verification and professional growth. Other challenges stem from security risks and financial complexities that further complicate the adoption process.
 
 Although some educational resources provide attestations to verify user achievements and contributions, the manual processes involved present several challenges. These include time inefficiency, limited transparency, lack of trust, and verification gaps, which undermine the reliability and scalability of skill verification in the Web3 ecosystem.
 
 ## Our Solution
 
 **Zenbit Badges** is a robust dApp designed to verify Web3 skills and track event participation through onchain attestations. It is integrated within the **Zenbit Web3 Skills Framework,** which emphasizes role-based badges that allow users to effectively showcase their expertise in the Web3 environment.

 ## Web3 Skills Framework
 
 The **Zenbit Web3 Skills Framework** is designed to accommodate both users who want to demonstrate their competencies in the Web3 ecosystem and individuals who are entirely new to Web3. It provides a structured pathway that guides users from foundational knowledge to professional specialization. The framework is aligned with the growth of the Web3 industry and community needs and enables users to build a verifiable portfolio of their competencies and achievements, recorded on-chain through attestations.
 
 The framework consists of four key levels:
 
 1. **Functional Web3 Skills:** This foundational level equips new users with the essential skills to get started in Web3. It covers both theoretical knowledge and practical cases on account creation, key management, and the use of a block explorer.
 2. **Web3 Literacy**: At this level, users advance to more complex concepts, including DeFi (Decentralized Finance), smart contracts, and gas fees. This stage provides a broader understanding of how these technologies shape the Web3 ecosystem.
 3. **Technical Professionalization:** In this stage, users specialize in one of four key profiles: DAO Incubation, Governance, DApp Development, or Protocol Development. This level focuses on developing the technical skills necessary to match industry growth, allowing users to not only participate in Web3 interactions but also contribute to research and development within the space.
 4. **Industrial Professionalization:** The final level is a continuation of the technical track, where users further deepen their expertise in their chosen profile. This stage prepares them for professional Web3 roles, enabling them to contribute to cutting-edge projects, conduct research, and develop new technologies.

 ### Future work
 
 Zenbit Badges plans to enhance its platform by implementing multi-attestation functionality to reduce gas consumption and improve efficiency by allowing multiple attestations to be bundled into a single transaction‚Äîmaking the system more cost-effective and accessible.
 
 Additionally, we plan to expand Zenbit Badges into a multichain platform, supporting multiple blockchain networks. This expansion will increase accessibility, enhance cross-chain compatibility, and improve scalability. By offering users the flexibility to choose their preferred network, we aim to create a more efficient and adaptable platform, better suited to the needs of the Web3 ecosystem.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/642/6

This area, though rich in natural beauty and cultural history, faces significant challenges like soil degradation, loss of biodiversity, and economic decline. Despite being one of France's leading regions in organic farming, it remains economically disadvantaged.
 
 Understanding Our Bioregion:
 We've defined our bioregion not just by physical boundaries but by the interconnected systems of nature and community that span beyond the Tarn-et-Garonne. This includes the broader southwest of France, bordered by the Pyrenees, the Massif Central, and the Atlantic Ocean. Our collaborative mapping efforts with local farmers, scientists, community leaders, and residents have helped us identify both the challenges we face and the opportunities ahead.
 
 Th√©ra's Role and Evolution:
 Th√©ra started as a group of dedicated individuals‚Äîfarmers, ecologists, builders, educators‚Äîwho shared a common goal of regenerating our land and community. We've recently formalized our organization as a non-profit and are working within a network of both for-profit and non-profit partners. Our aim is to amplify individual efforts through collective action.
 Our mission is to promote regenerative practices and build resilience against today's global challenges. We support projects in areas like biodiversity, sustainable housing, culture, new economic models, health, and education. Our center serves as a hub where project leaders can collaborate, share knowledge, and access resources. It's also a place where the public can learn about and engage with regenerative practices.
 
 Current Initiatives:
 1. Waterway Restoration:
 We're collaborating with local river authorities and community groups to restore waterways using natural, low-tech methods like creating beaver dams. This helps improve water management, boost biodiversity, and strengthen community ties.
 2. Affordable Eco-Housing:
 In partnership with local municipalities, we're working to build affordable, eco-friendly homes in and around villages. This initiative aims to attract new residents‚Äîlike digital nomads and young farmers‚Äîby offering modern comforts in a rural setting. We're also providing training in regenerative farming to support sustainable livelihoods.
 3. Th√©ra B√©binet Buildathon:
 We're organizing a one-time event next year called the Buildathon. We'll bring together architects, builders, permaculture experts, volunteers, and local residents to construct all the necessary facilities for our center in a focused effort. This includes sustainable homes, community spaces, and regenerative agricultural systems. The Buildathon is more than a construction project; it's a demonstration of what's possible through collaboration.
 
 Our Land and Vision:
 Our center is situated on 5.2 hectares of land that has been unused for over 40 years. It includes:
 ‚Ä¢ A main house that we plan to use as both a workspace and a community gathering place.
 ‚Ä¢ Plans for a market garden, food forest, medicinal garden, and natural swimming pool, all designed using permaculture principles.
 ‚Ä¢ A small ruin along a public walking path that we're renovating to strengthen our connection with the local community.
 ‚Ä¢ A buildable area where we'll construct eco-houses and cabins for eco-tourism, providing unique experiences and generating income to support our projects.
 We aim to be as self-sufficient as possible in terms of food, energy, and water. Our land will serve as both a practical example of sustainable living and a sanctuary for peace and wellness. We also intend to host workshops, events, and performances to engage and inspire others.
 
 Community Engagement and Cultural Heritage:
 We value the knowledge and traditions of local elders and communities. By engaging with those who have a deep connection to the land, we ensure our efforts are respectful and culturally sensitive. This helps us integrate ancestral practices into our work and strengthen community bonds.
 
 Financial Strategies and Building BioFi Capacity:
 We've combined public grants, private donations, and our own efforts to fund our initiatives so far. However, we recognize that funding for regenerative projects is often fragmented and insufficient. To address this, we're developing elegant.capital, a financing platform designed to streamline funding for regenerative projects by:
 ‚Ä¢ Combining various sources like loans, investments, grants, crowdfunding, and donations.
 ‚Ä¢ Simplifying access to funds to accelerate project timelines.
 ‚Ä¢ Encouraging broader participation in regional regeneration efforts.
 We've learned that aligning financial mechanisms with our ecological and social values is crucial, though it comes with challenges like navigating regulations and ensuring fair access to funds.
 
 Challenges and Key Questions:
 As we move forward, we're considering:
 ‚Ä¢ How can we design financial mechanisms that are both effective and just?
 ‚Ä¢ What governance structures best support collective decision-making and resource distribution?
 ‚Ä¢ How do we scale our initiatives without compromising our core values?
 
 Use of Gitcoin Funds:
 Support from Gitcoin would help us:
 ‚Ä¢ Host Community Events: These events will help refine our strategies, build networks, and foster collaboration.
 ‚Ä¢ Develop Infrastructure for Elegant.Capital: We'll address legal requirements and build technical systems for transparency and efficiency.
 ‚Ä¢ Enhance Communication: Creating engaging materials will help us share our vision and attract more support.
 ‚Ä¢ Facilitate Workshops: Training community members in governance and resource management will empower more people to participate actively.
 
 Conclusion:
 At Th√©ra, we're driven by a genuine belief in what's possible when people come together with a shared purpose. We embrace uncertainty as a space for innovation, taking deliberate steps to transform challenges into opportunities. Our work is about nurturing a movement that values the land, honors our heritage, and builds a sustainable future.
 By supporting us, you're contributing to a collective effort to regenerate our region in meaningful ways. We invite you to join us in turning possibility into reality.
 Thank you for considering our proposal. We're grateful for the opportunity to share our vision with you.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/18/6

The core of the protocol is a registry (dm3-registry) for the relevant communication information such as public keys for encryption and signatures and delivery information. Messages are delivered via a decentralized network of delivery service nodes that serve as a message cache or gateway to another messaging protocol or service.
 
 The dm3 registry is based on ENS, i.e. the dm3 profile is added as a text record to the ENS name.
 
 The aim of dm3 is to suggest a common base standard for web3 messaging, on which further protocols and applications can be built to create a silo-free, secure, self-determined, decentralized messaging ecosystem - based on web3 technology.
 
 This allows users not only to have full control over their data and messages but also to choose the messaging app that best suits their needs and preferences, without the compromise of being limited to a particular ecosystem.
 
 To achieving the goal of building a messaging standard we have launched the Interoperability Initiative: a welcoming invitation to other messaging protocols, dApps and users to integrate dm3 protocol in order to achieve interoperability regardless of your app/protocol of choosing. 
 
 Our protocol is open source and we aim to build with the web3 community, so feedback is welcome!

 ## Introduction
 
 We've developed a tool that has enabled NFT communities on Ethereum, Optimism, and Base to acquire ENS sub-domains at zero cost. This significant accomplishment was made possible through the implementation of ENS wildcard resolution.
 
 ## Empowering NFT communities
 
 Our application has already empowered ENS name holders to seamlessly connect their names/domains with the contract addresses of NFT collections, resulting in the automatic provision of free subdomains linked to individual token IDs.
 
 ## Real-world Example
 
 As a real-world example, consider the OptiChads collection, on Optimism. Every Chad owner automatically received an ENS subdomain under `optichads.eth`, precisely corresponding to the token ID of their NFT. For instance, the subdomain `69.optichads.eth`, directly resolves to the address of the individual who owns Chad #69
 
 ## Roadmap
 
 We are excited to announce our plans to expand our offering to other Layer 2 (L2) chains, including PGN, Zora, Arbitrum, and Polygon, providing even more NFT communities with the benefits of instant ENS sub-domains.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/642/61

 2. Appropriately value natural ecosystems and their services while creating a monetary system that is backed by climate/ecology positive projects.
 
 3. Seed the Solarpunk paradigm
 
 $Earth has been designed to make this happen by -
 
 1. Incentivizing users to purge their petro $$$ to mint $Earth directly at the protocol and use those $$$ to fund projects in renewables, permaculture, Ev charging stations, electric buses/trains , ecosystem conservation/regeneration, agroforestry, energy storage, eco-villages etc
 
 2. Inherently ascribing value to ecosystem services created by the projects we fund, by selling $Earth at a premium to the $ value of projects in the neoliberal world. $Earth acts as a unit of account for the $ value of the projects in our treasury + potential yields these projects will generate and the positive externalities created by these projects ( healthy soil, carbon sequestration, clean air, biodiversity etc)
 
 3. Creating utility for $Earth by creating a network of regenerative/solarpunk merchants who are willing to provide their goods and services in exchange of $Earth.

 Free workshops in six Brazilian cities aiming to educate on ENS and onboard developers from major universities in Brazil.
 
 ## Description
 After organizing [a workshop on ENS in Rio de Janeiro](https://twitter.com/blockful_io/status/1773344877675225539%5C), with the support of the ENS DAO, We were able to test and experience the feasibility model of this workshop, as well as gain a better understanding of the strong interest in web3 within the Brazilian community. The workshop reached maximum registration capacity and featured refreshments and beverages.
 ![Gueste on Luma ‚Äì Max capacity reached](https://i.postimg.cc/pXJnTg6s/Whats-App-Image-2024-04-04-at-12-08-14.jpg)
 
 After that, we aim to conduct workshops on ENS and its ecosystem in the major tech universities in Brazil to onboard developers, and produce content to document these learning moments. The university environment in Brazil is quite open to new technologies, presenting a significant opportunity to onboard a large number of these students.
 
 The workshop will also invite young people from underprivileged areas to increase their access to technology and gain a better understanding of ENS, and its ecosystem.

 An open source mobile wallet with account abstraction (ERC4337) that you can customize for your community. 
 
 # Why yet another wallet?
 Existing wallets are either for tech savvy people (e.g. metamask), or traders (people who already have money to invest).
 
 But as a web3 project or DAO, what you want is an easy way for your community to receive and transfer *your tokens* (ERC20, ERC721, ...) without any technical or financial distraction.
 
 Some web3 communities end up developing their own wallet but it feels like a waste of time and energy. It feels like back in the days where everyone was redeveloping a blog engine before Wordpress came along.

GG22,GG22 OSS - dApps and Apps,Zenbit Badges,0x51c3BaE3025E0108fd8c5C84Eb089fA8F488d6af,https://twitter.com/zenbitMX,https://github.com/zenbitETH,Zenbit Badges,https://badges.zenbit.mx,APPROVED,"Zenbit Badges (ZB) is an identity dApp that leverages the **Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)** to provide user-friendly, onchain certification of Web3 skills and activities, guiding users toward technical or industrial professionalization. By offering a **standardized framework** for skill verification and community-driven education, **Zenbit Badges** enhances Web3 accessibility, supports financial inclusion, and accelerates ecosystem adoption. It enables users to showcase their skills effectively during both live and virtual events with a secure and transparent method for certifying the mastery of Web3 tools space. Acting as a bridge between Web3 technology and mainstream users, the platform creates an intuitive and inclusive environment for learning, skill verification, and professional growth.

 ![Zenbit Badges Main Screen](https://github.com/zenbitETH/Public-Assets/blob/main/Zenbit%20Badges/zb4.png?raw=true)
 
 ### Problem
 
 In the rapidly evolving landscape of Web3, communities often rely on manual attestations to verify user achievements and contributions. This manual process is fraught with challenges:
 
 - **Lack of Standardization**: Without a unified system, different communities employ various methods for attestation, leading to inconsistency and confusion among users.
 - **Verification Gaps**: Manual attestations are prone to errors and can be manipulated, raising concerns about the authenticity and integrity of the certifications.
 - **Inefficiency**: The manual process is time-consuming for issuers and recipients, hindering scalability and broader adoption.
 - **Limited Transparency**: Participants cannot easily verify the legitimacy of their attestations, which undermines trust in the system.
 
 These issues create barriers to entry for newcomers and impede the professional growth of existing community members. There is a clear need for a streamlined, secure, and verifiable attestation mechanism that enhances user experience and trust.
 
 ### ZB Solution
 
 Zenbit Badges addresses these challenges by introducing a decentralized application (dApp) coupled with a smart contract that automate the attestation process. The key components of our solution include:
 
 - **Onchain Verification**: By leveraging Ethereum Attestation Service, we ensure that all attestations are immutable and transparently recorded onchain.
 - **Four Types of Quiz Verification**: To validate the legitimacy of each attestation, we have implemented four distinct quiz mechanisms:
  - Multi-Option Quizzes: Assess users‚Äô knowledge through multiple-choice questions relevant to the certification.
  - DAO Membership Verification: Confirm active participation in a DAO via Safe Multisig and ENS integration.
  - Content Creation Verification: Authenticate authorship of Mirror articles.
  - Secret Word/Written Quizzes: Utilize unique codes or written responses to verify attendance at live events or workshops.
 - **Smart Contracts for Proof Generation**: Our contracts automatically generate cryptographic proofs upon successful quiz completion, which are then recorded onchain to attest to the user‚Äôs achievement.
 - **User-Friendly Interface**: The dApp offers an intuitive interface that guides users through the verification process, making it accessible even to those new to Web3 technologies.
 
 By automating verification and leveraging smart contracts, Zenbit Badges provides a robust solution that enhances trust, efficiency, and scalability in community attestations.
 
 ### Web3 Skills Framework
 
 The **Zenbit Web3 Skills Framework** serves as the backbone for our badge system, outlining a clear pathway for users to develop and demonstrate their Web3 competencies. This framework is meticulously designed to align with industry standards and community needs, ensuring relevance and value for all participants.
 
 It considers four specialization levels
 
 1. Functional Web3 Skills
 2. Web3 literacy to achieving
 3. Technical professionalization
 4. Industrial professionalization
 
 
 ![Zenbit Badges Tech Stack](https://github.com/zenbitETH/Public-Assets/blob/main/Zenbit%20Badges/Web3SkillsF.png?raw=true)
 
 For onboarding purposes, we have defined a general introduction process to help the user familiarize themselves with the main Web3 tools. After this onboarding, users can choose a skills path depending on their context and interests.
 
 The first path we are testing is the¬†**DAO Incubation pilot program**. We designed this program for u**niversity projects conducting scientific research or technology development**¬†that can leverage Web3 tools to socialize and fund their initiatives. Throughout this process, participants have acquired essential knowledge in using Web3 tools for DAO management and development and strategies for documentation and communication in decentralized environments.¬†**The program has 8 Badges to be obtained**¬†by the participants, each requiring them to complete a set of activities and tasks that are later verified onchain with Zenbit Badges:

 My journey began in 2017 during a month-long sailing trip through the Windward Islands. It was incredible and life altering, mostly because of the stark contrasts I encountered in almost every island we visited. Beautiful magical places on this earth but also so many dead white skeletal coral reefs. üò•
 
 The stark reality of seeing and experiencing the environmental degradation humans have caused to the ocean pained me so much. It was then that I changed my course to be in service of the planet. My WHY are my nieces and nephews, and all of the children and future generations who deserve to truly experience the ocean's increble awe inspiring beauty, mysteries and peace. 
 
 Since then, I‚Äôve dedicated my life to being solution oriented, finding - amplyfying and accelerating the growth of the technological innovations that have the power to regenerate the planet. I have been writing and amplyfing solutions for the planet for almost a decade and have been applying my extensive tech marketing and startup background to work in building a regenerative economy that heals both our planet and its communities. 
 
 ![sandrasailing](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S12_4wIxkx.jpg)
 
 I believe the solutions are within reach, we just need the motivation, funding, and momentum to make them happen. thankfully so much of that is happening in the ReFi community - you wonderful humans are the wind in my sails. üíó 
 
 My path led me to Tulum, a place rich in culture and natural beauty but fragile due to human development. Here, I found my Ocean Tribe and cofounded [ReFi Tulum](https://refitulum.io/), where we are committed to elevating and accelerating solutions like plastic sequestration, ecological restoration, and activating and empowering our community to take postive action for the planet.
 
 Here‚Äôs a look at my impact:
 
 **Launch of ReFi Tulum** 
 ReFi Tulum has been a key focus. We have been activating our community and connecting with local partners to both reward people for planet positive work. I‚Äôve led various initiatives in developing scalable solutions for ocean health and regeneration. Our initiatives are aimed at plastic neutrality, regenerative tourism and regenerative mobility with ReFi Rides. We have been on the ground activating our community and making real on the ground impact, making a difference in places like the precious and beautiful Sian Ka‚Äôan Biosphere.
 ![siankaangroupbeach](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1hiw_Llkx.jpg)
 
 **Education and Growth** 
 My commitment extends beyond action. I work daily to inspire others to join the ReFi revolution, hosting workshops, online courses and speaking at events about the intersection of Web3, climate, and community-based initiatives. I‚Äôve mentored countless individuals, especially women, in adopting blockchain technology as a tool for empowerment and environmental stewardship. At the NFT Boutique in Tulum we host weekly workshops on AI, ReFi, Blockchain and crypto onboarding.
 
 ![boutiquegroupai](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1S1FOIgyl.jpg)
 
 ![workshopAIboutique](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryEvK_8xkx.jpg)
 
 As part of my commitment to GROW the movement, I write regularly about ReFi topics in my [column in Grit Daily](https://gritdaily.com/future-crypto-is-refi/) and I believe passionately that ReFi is the FUTURE.
 
 ![futurerefi](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyRDMFUgJx.png)
 
 
 **Operational Support** 
 As a key team member in several ReFi projects and DAOS such as [LETSGROWDAO](https://www.letsgrow.network/), [SolarpunkDAO](https://www.solarpunkdao.earth/), and Solarpunk Guild, I provide operational support, strategic guidance, and advocacy for our cause. My role at ReFi Tulum includes being a steward for our environmental projects, engaging stakeholders, and ensuring that every initiative aligns with our mission to create a circular economy.
 
 **Impact on Local Communities and Bioregions** 
 I‚Äôve been on the front lines of community engagement, from organizing beach cleanups in Tulum, to educating and onboarding my community into Gitcoin, ReFi and and ocean conservation. The joy of seeing people reconnect with nature drives me to continue this work. Each cleanup, each interaction, fosters a deeper connection with the Earth and nurtures a sense of responsibility for everyone involved. It can be quite a spiritual experience!
 ![groupcleanupplayapublica](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByEKFuLlyx.jpg)
 
 As I continue to grow this work, I firmly believe that our strength lies in collective action. Together, through ReFi, we can regenerate not just our environments but our relationships with one another and the planet üåä
 
 
 The launch of the ‚ÄòFierce Feminine of ReFi‚Äô NFT collective and collection serves as a platform for female artists of Tulum to gain global recognition, while contributing to a Tulum‚Äôs regenerative future. We see this collection as a jumping off point for each artist to gain a wider following in the web3 and digital space. Beyond their art, these women are performers, teachers, healers, guides, and fierce protectors of Pachamama, deeply committed to their communities and the planet.
 
 We were pleased and honored to be chosen to launch this collection as part of Celosphere Summer and highlighted as collection with a positive cause.

 **Project Overview** 
 **[ReFi Lagos](https://x.com/ReFiLagos01)** is a grassroot initiative and regenerative hub combating deforestation and climate change in Nigeria. By organizing tree-planting events and raising climate change awareness, we aim to restore ecosystems, support biodiversity, and empower farmers. **ReFi Lagos is supported by ReFi DAO, Gitcoin, Celo Public Goods, and Silvi Protocol**
 **Why Does It Matter?**
 Deforestation in Nigeria, mostly driven by logging, urbanization, and agriculture, has led to the [loss of 96% of Nigeria‚Äôs primary forest](https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/09/deforestation-nigeria-has-lost-96-of-its-forest-ncf/). This has exacerbated climate change impacts, including biodiversity loss and [severe coastal erosion in the Niger Delta region](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2022/6/1/in-oil-rich-niger-delta-coastal-erosion-is-outliving-residents) and other coastal communities.
 ![Deforestation in Nigeria](https://i.ibb.co/yRPM3DG/Gitcoin.png) 
 
 Addressing this issue is crucial for environmental sustainability and community well-being, and we are passionate about solving this problem. 
 
 **Our Solution:** 
 **Scaling Tree Planting With [Project Osisi](http://osisi.earth/)**
 Osisi (or tree) is a platform empowering local farmers to nurse and trade seedlings for tree-planting projects in Africa. We‚Äôve set up a 1040-square-meter pilot tree garden in Badagry where we are currently collecting and nursing coconut seedlings. We‚Äôve also [installed water access](https://youtu.be/rTLRypDf9s4), funded by [Gitcoin Grant 21‚Äî Climate Coordination Network](https://climatecoordination.org/datatabase/climate-round-portal/climate-round-results-gg21) 
 **Why Badagry?** 
 Badagry is a coastal community and border town famous for nursing and growing coconuts using indigenous farming methods. With the global coconut products market expected to reach $38.58 billion by 2030, fuelled by popularity in food and cosmetics industries, Lagos State government is encouraging the [establishment of more seed farms to boost production for local consumption and for export](https://thenationonlineng.net/lagos-eyes-38-58b-coconut-market-with-increased-production/). Badagry is also home to the largest coconut market in Nigeria, [supplying coconut across Nigeria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXX9TbUe28c), **a market of over 230 million people.** 
 ![Jegeme Island](https://i.ibb.co/cL7vtj5/Whats-App-Image-2024-10-23-at-14-20-04-7b0d0b3e.jpg) 
 
 With its strategic location and proximity to the border, the pilot garden will serve as both a nursing home and a collection point for tree seedlings from other West African nations. We are currently nursing 100 coconut tree seedlings and aim to collect and nurse over 10,000 tree seedlings during the pilot phase. Our garden also grows bananas, palm trees, and vegetables‚Äî Nigerian pumpkin leaves (Telfairia occidentalis).

 *[Scaling Natural Capital With ReFi](https://blog.refidao.com/refi-roundup-50/)*
 
 **Challenges**
 *Lack of climate change awareness, particularly in rural and underserved communities, with low climate advocacy. [As of 2020, more than six Nigerians out of 10 never heard about climate change](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1269701/knowledge-of-climate-change-topic-in-nigeria-by-area/)*
 *Environmental conservation can be difficult, especially in rural communities that rely on firewood and charcoal to cook their everyday meals*
 *Navigating the complexities of Climate science and Web3 concept could be challenging for rural communities*
 
 **Opportunities**
 Climate is a multitrillion-dollar opportunity. The global carbon market is estimated at $272 billion, with a 20% annual growth rate. The voluntary carbon market is anticipated to be worth more than $1 billion, growing at 50% annually. [The global impact investing market is estimated at $1.164 trillion](https://www.impactinvest.org.uk/learning-hub/the-impact-investing-market/) 
 Expanding our impact by onboarding more farmers, environmentalists, and nature lovers to learn about Web3 and ReFi could increase financial opportunities and scale nature-based solutions in Africa

 It shows the transactions as per the new entities introduced: userOp, Bundle, Bundler, Entrypoint, factory, paymaster, etc, as well as have Tracer abilities to debug your transactions.
 
 This is helpful for all the participants of the Account Abstraction ecosystem: Developers can test out their applications in an easier fashion, for users to easily confirm their transactions, and for researchers to get a holistic view of different participating entities. 
 
 With new Tracer capabilities, and the abilitiy to visualize your transaction flow, it also have become much easier to debug your transactions.
 
 Impact of EIP-4337:
 
 We've given free API access to 50+ dapps, wallets & infrastructure companies serving 2.5 Million API requests in the last year. 
 
 It is standardizing features of Account Abstraction on EVM chains. This will enable easier onboarding of a user by removing the need to understand concepts such as passphrases, keys, gas fees, and chains. The user will get a smooth web2-like experience (imagine NFTs on Reddit).
 
 How are we different from etherscan and other block explorers?
 
 The top explorers are focused on traditional transactions. The 4337 standards introduced many new entities with very little which are wrapped in metadata when creating a transaction on-chain. JiffyScan treats the new entities as first-class citizens and hides away the added metadata, giving a clear view to the user about their interactions.
 
 The Project is Open-Sourced and free to use. We're also giving a rate-limited to confirm the UserOp on the chain and get additional data around it. Our explorer also have Tracer capabilities which are not available in other account abstraction explorers.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/610/68

 2023/10/7:
 
 1: We're so excited to announce that Inferer has officially launched our Inferer Identity product https://id.inferer.xyz NOW. Brand new design, beautiful design style, smoonth product user experience. No more chrome plugin edition, full mode desktop product, just gorgeous. We have put so much time in iteracting Identity product, including 3 versions PRD, 7 versions Design documents, and 3 big rounds of internal iteration from v1.0 to v1.3(current version). And now we made it, with such a great product quality which we're pretty pround of. Hope you will like it.
 
 ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F71P27-akAAcK-9?format=jpg&name=large)
 
 2: This brand new identity product introduces our latest great Inferer User Portrait system, which utilize our internal user label system and classfication algorithm and provide a great way to check crypto user's portrait. We believe it would generate quite lot of values in future user related products. We're pretty excited about that.
 
 ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F71QPw0bsAAdQtv?format=jpg&name=large)
 
 3: Moreover, Identity is so good, but we're also developing a crazy product in the meanwhile - Inferer Airdrop. We've mentioned that before, and you could imagine that it has progressed quite far away both in product concept and engineering feasibility verification. All these are getting done while we're polishing our great Inferer Identity product. Lots of new stuff and ideas, just crazy. Contact us to get enrolled in early bird product version and we do have an exciting plan to enroll, expand and stimulate. Airdrop would not be a simple airdrop any more. We believe it did have a chance to generate quite much value to our crypto community. It would be mind blowing.

 1: We're excited to announce that Inferer officially supports Inferer Ranking on website https://ranking.inferer.xyz. It offers great product quality with concise on-chain data analysis! Brand new product user experience, new design interface, more advanced data analysis, we're offering a high level product and we're pretty proud of it. Again, we're committed to keep improving Inferer Ranking and believe it would bring huge impact in crypto project analysis.
 
 2: We have another great product Inferer Identity is on the way to get online as well (expected late Aug early Sep). That's also amazing! If would introduce a great scoring system for crypto users and provide great values for projects to check their target users avatars. Please give us a little bit time to build it to a great quality and we have confidence that it would surprise you.
 
 3: Recently we're discussing a lot on future airdrop product and have a great finding on this. We're having a demo to verify the concept. We do believe it would be a thing to crypto community.

 2023/4/7:
 
 1: For Inferer community gitcoin members, we're back! Back here to report our progress regularly, and brings with an amazing new product - Inferer Ranking.
 
 2: We're excited to announce that Inferer could not only support the on-chain user address identity analysis, but also for on-chain contract web3 projects (especially NFT project). This would be obviously a tremendous scope improvement for Inferer. We hope not only we could provide users efficient identity look up tool (compared with checking transactions in etherscan or polygonscan), but also we could provide a brand new & efficient way helping users checking projects(especially NFT) users' group portraits, which could be a great reference for new users to check whether a project is with good quality or just a scam project to rug pull. We believe some new crypto users would need this and we treat this in a very valuable way!
 
 3: We love Reddit! Not only their avatar nft users grow exponentially from 3m to 10m, but also for the unbelievably great crypto-friendly culture. We enjoy quite a lot in having discussions in Reddit. And it helped us to determine our first project analysis landing on Reddit Avatar Collections. It's quite valuable for us to analyze all avartar through, which gives us a very clear concept that which avartar series is now trending and which nft now leads in profits. We believe this would be quite useful for those reddit avatar traded users. In the long run, we're going to cover many more projects and willing to bring great values for crypto users. We believe this would definetly bring great values to crypto and help contribute to great user ecosystem on chain.

 2023/02/16:
 
 1: We're excited to announce officially that Inferer now has a brand new official site https://www.inferer.xyz. It brings totally new design language and much better user experience. This new version shows great product level in Inferer. We believe that you all would love it.
 
 
 2: We brought a great internal engineering product here: Inferer label backend system. In order to reach unbelievably lots of labels, we need to improve our label processing efficiency, in a massive improvement way. In detail, it needs to handle label creation, label deletion, label edit, label check, label daily update, label comparison, label degrees and many more label related operations, all in a user friendly way with great efficiency. This leads to our new coming amazing product: Inferer label backend system, which aimed to cover these requirements and take overall label processing efficiency to a much higher level. Inferer label system has come to v1.0 and been put into use NOW. It would also iterate very quickly. We're very passionate to polish this tool to help Inferer reach to next stage.
 
 
 3: We're excited to announce that AWS has decided to help fund in Inferer! We had amazing conversations and had a very great consensus: Inferer is a great project and would like to see the achievements that Inferer would take in the future. That would be a very interesting thing that we both believed.

 2022/11/28:
 
 
 1. We're excited to announce that Inferer Search has been renamed to Inferer Identity.
 
 
 2. Inferer Identity has updated to v0.0.13. In this version, we included a major new feature: Inferer Label, which would be the key to our future user identity analysis service. Inferer Label would serve directly into our user portrait system and become the data basis in our evaluation algorithms. We would increase lots of labels to help us reach the precise analysis result.
 
 
 3. For Inferer Label, not only we're adding more & more labels, we also try to dig more interesting dimensions on labels. We add 'degree' metric to Inferer Label, such as ""Big Ens User"", which refers to users who adopted more than 5 Ens names on their account or ""Ens Collector"", which refers to users who adopted more than 30 Ens names on their account, this extend info would help a lot in figuring out user's motive or interest. We're excited to see the benefit this brings to our evaluation process.
 
 
 4. On engineering, we want to reach the point that Inferer Internal System could label new qualified users day by day, automatically. And we have covered this NOW.

 2022/10/22:
 
 - Inferer Search has updated to v0.0.10. We put quite much time on many details which we believe would improve users' experience in a long time. Some of them listed:
 
 
  1. always focus on the address edit text which could help users to replace new address, and avoid delete address one by one
 
 
  2. fix that some users can't launch ""Inferer Search"" through mouse' right click ""Inferer 0x*****"" after they sleep the computer
 
 
  3. add more twitter KOLs in Recommend feature, which facilitate users' check on these KOLs' identity
 
 
  4. add more hackers info in Warning feature, which we hope could help keep users from scams
 
 
  5. integrate internal server APIs to optimize the JSON API response time
 
 
  6. add support for users to switch their binding address to inferer account

 In 2020, I descended into a mad dash to volunteer for any project attempting to address communication and coordination failures. Through these efforts, I helped co-found a 501c3 (with the help of Open Collective üôå) called The Trim Tab ([https://trimtab.gitbook.io/the-trim-tab/about](https://trimtab.gitbook.io/the-trim-tab/about)), a volunteer collective that contributed our skills to metacrisis-focused projects. The organization attempted decentralization but didn't utilize any Web3 technology. 
 
 ‚ò†Ô∏è Forboding music ‚ò†Ô∏è
 
 While we were able to work with some incredible organizations, Moloch eventually struck and the initiative collapsed under the weight of inadequate incentive and coordination mechanisms. At the same time, another Web2 organization I was volunteering with called Complexity Adventures ([https://www.complexityadventures.com/](https://www.complexityadventures.com/)) met a similar fate... I was fine... I was totally fine! ü•≤

Traditional methods for producing and trading green assets often lead to issues with quality and reliability, reducing trust and effectiveness. Global participation in trading green crypto assets remains low compared to other sectors, and outdated processes with heavy reliance on intermediaries hinder monetization and innovation. The current industry focus on carbon offsets overlooks other vital green assets like biodiversity credits. Finally, there is a pressing need for innovative financial instruments, such as futures, indexes, and nature-backed currencies, to effectively drive market liquidity.
 
 ‚û°Ô∏è **The Regen Atlas is set to transform this landscape by providing a global, open-source platform for individuals and organizations to support or contribute to environmental projects.** ‚¨ÖÔ∏è
 
 ## Solution: The Regen Atlas üó∫Ô∏è
 
 The Regen Atlas is a location-based green crypto-asset marketplace designed to address market inefficiencies by displaying all existing green crypto assets and aggregating their entire value chain (i.e. issuers, tokenizers, certifiers, raters, regulators, buyers). Specifically, the platform aims to offer:
 1. **Support for Diverse Green Assets**: The number of green crypto-assets has been constantly growing over the last years. On the Regen Atlas, users have access to a broad spectrum of green crypto-assets (and soon corresponding stakeholders) that go beyond just carbon assets, including but not limited to biodiversity, agriculture, green and blue bonds, and forwards contracts. 
 2. **Aggregated Certifications**: The platform will compile and display ratings from specialized certifiers, offering users a centralized resource for assessing the quality and potential impact of various environmental projects. Aggregation will empower users with the information necessary to make informed decisions around green assets.
 3. **Top-down Territorial Incentives**: As a geo-interface, the Regen Atlas plans to allow users to create and publish incentives tied to specific geographic locations, developing natural capital in the most impactful areas
 4. **Support for Existing Green Assets**: In the future, the platform will enable the tokenization of existing green assets on the blockchain, making them more accessible and tradable. 
 
 ## What has been done since the last round ‚úÖ üí™
 
 Since our last update, the Regen Atlas has released its Prototype v3, where users can now purchase green assets [directly through the interface](https://x.com/theregenatlas/status/1833792865685688754) on the Celo network. In addition:
 
 1. **Database Expansion**: Our asset database has seen substantial growth, now boasting up to 124 assets from 14 different providers, compared to the 109 assets from prototype v2. We‚Äôre receiving new listing demands every week.
 2. **New Partnerships**: The Regen Atlas joined forces with OpenVino to [list their organic wine tokens](https://paragraph.xyz/@regenatlas/regen-atlas-partners-with-openvino).
 3. **Networking at Token 2049**: The Regen Atlas‚Äô team was in Singapore this year, attending Token 2049 and building presence in Asian communities.
 
 ## Outputs üßë‚Äçüíª
 
 A lot is happening lately, and the Regen Atlas team is planning some major releases (prototype v4 featuring Certifiers, backend scaling, listings in the pipeline‚Ä¶). Contributions to this GG22 will directly support those major milestones ahead.
 
 Grant work will result in the following concrete outputs, from most to less likely depending on donations:
 
 * Add additional green assets and providers to the database.
 * Launch the v4 UI, which includes Certifiers: a special stakeholder group in green assets that evaluate the quality of the assets.
 * Secure and complete additional partnerships like the recent [LandX one](https://paragraph.xyz/@regenatlas/regen-atlas-partners-with-landx)
 * Pay for a part-time communication / growth manager to develop the Atlas‚Äô listings, including upcoming listings for Certifiers.
 * Deployment of an MVP by EoY that can support up to 100k assets simultaneously.

It was developed by the Chaineye team specifically for users' small-amount transfer scenarios. Launched for 10 months, Minibridge has already processed 544K transactions and served 204K Web3 users. In user ratings on dappsheriff.com, Minibridge ranked first among all cross-chain bridge projects and was awarded ""Best Tool of the Year"" in the ""PARTY AWARD 2024"" annual selection by PA News.
 
 
 Key Features
 Chaineye was born from the Web3 community and we build products for the community‚Äôs needs. To better serve the community, Chaineye has built many free tools such as Onchain Map, CEX Transfer Fees, Multichain Gas, RPC List, etc. The Mini Bridge was designed specifically for retail investors with small-amount cross-chain transfer requests, including the following features:
 1. Zero bridge fees: We don‚Äôt charge any bridge fees at all. This means users will get the same amount of assets on the destination chains. We are built for retail investors and we believe our community like free services. Only a minimum gas fee on the destination chain is charged.
 2. Fastest transactions: Our bridge has the fastest bridging experience across all existing bridges. The bridging time largely depends on the confirmation time of source and destination blockchains. We don‚Äôt want our users to wait any longer than the evitable blockchain transaction time. 
 3. Designed especially for small-amount transfer scenarios such as gas refill, airdrop claiming, moving funds, etc. It helps to save huge money and time for individual investors when doing so.
 4. Gas swap: Our community wants to use the destination chain directly after bridging. We get it! The gas swap feature allows users to swap a small amount of source chain ETH to the destination chain native gas token. It is very useful for those chains where ETH is not the native gas token such as BNB Chain, Polygon, ZetaChain, ZkFair, Avalanche, Map, Mantle, and Metis. 
 5. Fast Integration: Our team is monitoring the market closely and is ready to integrate the latest blockchains in time. Chaineye Mini Bridge currently supports a total of 24 networks including the latest Blast EVM L2 and Merlin BTC L2 blockchain.
 6. Open API: We have opened the API docs on our documentation site. Any individuals or third parties can go through the API and seamlessly integrate Mini Bridge into their application. Chaineye Mini Bridge works in the same style for both requests from our front-end UI and API endpoints.
 7. Security: To prevent the potential security concern of smart contracts, we have implemented our bridge in a hybrid style - a combination of EOA and smart contracts. EOA for cross-chain transfers and smart contracts for cross-chain gas swaps. It helps to reduce the possibility of contract exploitation. In addition, we have our entire system audited and scrutinized by our security partners.
 8. Rewards and Earn: Our users can enjoy a big bridge discount by participating in our various marketing campaigns. In addition, they can also earn referral rewards in ETH and $pMNB whenever their referred address makes a transfer. Everything is transparent and Chaineye Mini Bridge is built for the community.

The [GTB (Greater Tkaronto Bioregion)](https://legacyproject.org/7gen/GreaterTkarontoBioregion.pdf) is 3 million hectares on the north shore of Lake Ontario in Canada. It has a population of 10 million people (a quarter of Canada's population, including Canada's largest city Toronto). It's on the Great Lakes, which have 21% of the world's fresh water. The GTB is organized by watersheds through 13 Conservation Authorities, and has the largest Greenbelt in the world. This diverse urban/rural bioregion is pursuing whole-systems work through both social and ecological regeneration. You can help us #ChangeTheStory for all generations now and into the future.
 
 
 The Legacy Project, a research and innovation group led by Brian Puppa and Susan Bosak, is the Core Team for the GTB ‚Äì because this work is the legacy project of our time. The history of the local bioregional work goes back to a 1992 *Regeneration* report by former Toronto Mayor and federal cabinet minister David Crombie. Said Crombie, ""This approach is both a way of doing things and a way of thinking. It's not a new concept. Indigenous peoples have long understood their connectedness to the ecosystem ‚Äì the land, water, air, and other life. Thinking about the whole bioregion helps focus attention on the interdependencies ‚Äì everything is connected to everything else."" We did a [short documentary with David Crombie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj9RdN_wx4g).
 
 We're working to #ChangeTheStory in the context of lifetimes across generations. We draw on an Indigenous concept of holistic, long-term thinking across seven generations while at the same time reflecting the modern context of a historic demographic shift. For the first time in history, as more people live longer, we will personally know (in our family and/or community) seven generations ‚Äì our own generation; three before us (parents, grandparents, great-grandparents); and three after us (children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren). There is significant comfort, insight, and power in this ability to ""touch time,"" to connect more generations than ever before.
 
 We are also pursuing a Third Way ‚Äì bringing Indigenous worldviews and knowledge together with Western science in a way that will enable us to walk into the greatest existential challenge humanity has ever faced. Check out this [video discussion featuring Dr. Dan Longboat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nYb_njU17g) of the Indigenous Environmental Institute at Trent University.
 
 In addition to being part of the Great Lakes Basin with 21% of the Earth's fresh water, the GTB has a couple of other [unique features](https://legacyproject.org/7gen/GTBLandFeatures.pdf). The **Niagara Escarpment**, on the west side of the GTB, is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. It stretches 725 km over a range of 430 m in elevations, and includes Great Lakes coastlines, cliff edges, talus slopes, wetlands, woodlands, limestone alvar pavements, oak savannahs, conifer swamps. It has 300 bird species, 55 mammals, 36 reptiles and amphibians, 90 fish and 100 varieties of special interest flora, as well as Cedar trees that are over 1,000 years old. The other unique feature of the GTB is the **Oak Ridges Moraine**, which is the *heart* of the bioregion. The Oak Ridges Moraine is a unique formation of sand and gravel deposits that captures rainwater, filters it, and slowly releases it into the landscape like a giant sponge. There are 16 major rivers and 66 river valley systems in the area.
 
 Following in David Crombie's footsteps, the Legacy Project has been doing whole-systems work for two decades and renewed the GTB vision three years ago. We frame it as growing a [Tree of Life](https://legacyproject.org/7gen/TreeOfLife.pdf) ‚Äì creating structures and processes to navigate through our current planetary predicament toward a fractally scale-linked story of Bioregional Earth.
 
 To help bring this vision alive, we ran the six-day [7-Generation Bioregional Earth Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBvxKv2Ie4M) in February, 2024. As a hybrid conference, several hundred people were involved locally as well as several thousand online. The Summit created momentum for the local work and laid the foundation for the recently launched [Bioregional Earth website](https://www.bioregionalearth.org), co-stewarded by Susan Bosak, Brian Puppa, Joe Brewer, and Penny Heiple.
 
 A civilization is about the deep story we all share over time ‚Äì the meanings, values, structures, processes that guide us collectively. Story is the most effective way human beings have to navigate through the world. Can we live into a **story of Bioregional Earth** based on right relationship with each other and the Earth ‚Äì one that puts life at the center of every decision and action in the context of Natural Law. To regenerate the entire Earth, we need this awareness woven into the daily ways we perceive, think, feel, and act.
 
 We draw on the [Bioregional Regeneration Platform](https://www.legacyproject.org/7gen/BioregionalRegenerationPlatform.pdf) developed by Joe Brewer, who is Co-Founder with Penny Heiple of the Design School for Regenerating Earth. This is a whole-systems approach that brings together and creates a rich interconnected context for the structures of a Bioregional Learning Center with a Portfolio of Projects and Funding/Governance. This approach to the work is about, in the words of Joe Brewer, ""organizing *with* the incredible natural intelligence of local living systems within our bioregions."" We need to be learning, working on the ground, and funding (flowing value) all at the same time. Find out more about holistic Bioregional Funding Ecosystems in this [three-part video series](https://www.legacyproject.org/7gen/fundingecosystems.html).
 
 We have a [GTB Portfolio of Projects](https://www.legacyproject.org/7gen/GTBBioregionalFunding.pdf) ‚Äì with a wide diversity of social and ecological regeneration projects ready to go, from small projects needing $5,000 to much larger projects that cross the bioregion, like the GeoAI land cover mapping which will support both strategic planning and monitoring. The map will be a knowledge commons for the GTB, used by Conservation Authorities (organized by watersheds), municipalities, the public, and others. It will include cultural and Indigenous layers for deeper bioregional thinking.
 
 Find out more about the projects in the GTB, the development of the Bioregional Funding Ecosystem, and meet some of the people/organizations involved in this evocative [video summary from the recent Bioregional Regenerative Finance Forum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwXkWBzjQEM) which took place in the GTB.
 
 All generations in the GTB are coming together to support the bioregional regeneration vision. Students and elders created the first GTB Bioregional Eco Market last year. This [inspiring market video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTEXPVi3IIM) features a student EcoLeader and her grandfather.

 First of all, I'd like to express my gratitude for your attention, for being part of this round, and for the opportunity to work on things that I see as necessary.
 
 Then I'd like to take this moment to share a bit more about what I'm currently working on and my contributions to the ReFi ecosystem over the last few years.
 
 I‚Äôm originally from S√£o Paulo, now based in Barcelona. Seeing the transformative potential of Barcelona in organizing economic alternatives ‚Äî like its strong social and solidarity economy and projects working in the ecosocial transition ‚Äî I've been interested in exploring this potential. With the launch of the ReFi Local Nodes network by ReFi DAO, this eventually led to me, together with the community forming around it, launching ReFi Barcelona as part of that network.
 
 ### **ReFi Barcelona - Bridging the Global with the Local üåç**
 
 [**ReFi Barcelona**](https://refibcn.cat/Home) is a collective dedicated to linking the global ReFi movement with local efforts in Barcelona and Catalunya, particularly within the cooperative and ecosocial transition ecosystems. We focus on building connections between decentralized technologies, regenerative finance, and groups already working on the ground to drive immediate benefits. 
 
 Some key initiatives:
 
 - [**ReFi Unconference Barcelona '24](https://www.notion.so/ReFi-UNCONFERENCE-Barcelona-c184c3edc6ef462c9e64d49985d2b63e?pvs=21) - *Decentralized Technologies for the Ecosocial Transition*:** A gathering organizes in April, as a collaboration with the Crypto Commons Association and Trusted Seed, focused on creating tangible change through local-global connections, hosted at Akasha Hub Barcelona. This event brought together participants to forge networks, share knowledge, and take meaningful action for regenerative finance.
 - [**Ecosystem Map**](https://refibcn.cat/Ecosystem+Map/Ecosystem+map): Information is the foundation for building bridges. The Ecosystem Map highlights the fields ReFi Barcelona wants to explore, showcasing both local value-aligned movements, such as the social economy, and global ReFi and Web3 communities.
 - **Constitution of ReFi BCN as a Coop:** Our goal is to create a shared structure that enhances collaboration and resource sharing, aligning global tools with local needs, while embodying and promoting cooperative values.
 
 ### **ReFi DAO and Global Coordination üåê**
 
 On a global level, I‚Äôve been contributing to [**ReFi DAO**](https://www.refidao.com/) as a Core Steward since the beginning of the year. The aim is to help ReFi DAO grow as a coordination platform for ReFi local nodes and the wider ecosystem, while also collaborating with other networks as part of the [Regen Coordi-Nation](https://www.regencoordination.xyz/). My involvement here has focused on a few areas:
 
 - **Planning and Implementing ReFi DAO 2.0**: Supporting the development and transition of ReFi DAO to a more resilient and decentralized model that ensures inclusivity and global participation.
 - **Exploring Knowledge Management Systems**: Looking into ways to advance ReFi DAO's knowledge structures to support collective learning and sharing‚Äîa shared resource for everyone in the regenerative finance ecosystem.
 - **Overall Organizational Support**
 
 ### **Other Contributions in the Ecosystem üë®‚Äçüåæ**
 
 - [**Trusted Seed**](https://trustedseed.org/): Since the beginning of the year, I've been one of the Gardeners (Stewards), supporting its operations and programs, such as the [Mentorship Program](https://trustedseed.org/participate/mentorship-program).
 - [**Traditional Dream Factory**](https://www.traditionaldreamfactory.com/): I was a steward for two seasons last year at TDF in the south of Portugal. TDF is a regenerative co-living space combining technology and nature, integrating ReFi tools and DAO mechanisms with regenerative land work.
 - [**PrimeDAO**](https://www.traditionaldreamfactory.com/): From 2022 to 2023, I contributed to integrating PrimeDAO further with the ReFi and Celo ecosystems, supporting early-stage ReFi projects and the ecosystem as a whole.

The core of the protocol is a registry (dm3-registry) for the relevant communication information such as public keys for encryption and signatures and delivery information. Messages are delivered via a decentralized network of delivery service nodes that serve as a message cache or gateway to another messaging protocol or service.
 
 The dm3 registry is based on ENS, i.e. the dm3 profile is added as a text record to the ENS name.
 
 The aim of dm3 is to suggest a common base standard for web3 messaging, on which further protocols and applications can be built to create a silo-free, secure, self-determined, decentralized messaging ecosystem - based on web3 technology.
 
 This allows users not only to have full control over their data and messages but also to choose the messaging app that best suits their needs and preferences, without the compromise of being limited to a particular ecosystem.
 
 To achieving the goal of building a messaging standard we have launched the Interoperability Initiative: a welcoming invitation to other messaging protocols, dApps and users to integrate dm3 protocol in order to achieve interoperability regardless of your app/protocol of choosing. 
 
 Our protocol is open source and we aim to build with the web3 community, so feedback is welcome!

 üëâ Community Certifications These web3 certifications are verified and validated by the community before being issued on-chain. The community is incentivized financially to curate data attempted to be certified.
 
 Learn more about how this works in our *[Docs](https://doc.thebadge.xyz/protocol-mechanics/how-it-works)*
 
 üëâ Third-party certifications require no verification since it is backed by a third-party company. In this case, TheBadge provides the infrastructure to design, issue, and distribute the certifications with the easiest user experience in web3. Final users are not required to have a Web3 wallet or gas to claim the Web3 certificate. All they need is a traditional email address.

 Being nominated by ReFi DAO for the Gitcoin Regen Citizen‚Äôs Round is such an honor. For me, this journey is all about blending the worlds of Web2 and Web3 to build a regenerative future.
 
 My passion for creating an impact started right out of college when I took my first job at the UN. Later, my path led me to nonprofit work and back to grad school in sunny Santa Barbara, California, where I began to see how crucial it was to protect nature and rethink our relationship with the Earth.
 
 That‚Äôs when I discovered the ideas behind regenerative economics and the power of Web3 for better coordination, decentralization, and access. I joined the ReFi community in 2021 and found my way into communications roles, starting with UCSB‚Äôs Blockchain Club.
 
 With my background in social science research and impact communications, I realized I could make a difference by telling powerful stories of regeneration.
 
 üéì¬†Regenerative R&D and Education
 
 I took the plunge and started hosting conversations with ReFi leaders as Head of Impact at Blockchain Acceleration Foundation. As I continued my research, I became a project fellow with the WEF Crypto Sustainability Coalition‚Äôs Web3 x Climate Action working group. We conducted in-depth, hour-long interviews with 23 Web3 and climate experts and co-authored a white paper on scaling climate action using blockchain.
 
 From there, I joined ReFi DAO as a content contributor, where I wrote ReFi RoundUps, reported on key regen trends and events on Twitter. The deeper I went, the more I realized how this community was bridging gaps between local needs and a global regenerative mission.
 
 üåé¬†Operations and Impact on Local Communities
 
 My passion for community building came to life in Spring of 2024 when I helped organize ReFi Unconference Barcelona, where I saw the magic of collaboration and connection up close.
 
 Working alongside the Crypto Commons Association, ReFi Barcelona, and Trusted Seed, we created a space where local eco-movements‚Äîlike degrowth and cooperative initiatives‚Äîcould connect with decentralized tech. This event really showed me how important it is to work from the ground up and foster meaningful connections.
 
 As part of the ReFi Local Node Beta Incubator, I began brainstorming the formation of a local node in Santa Barbara with fellow regens in the area. We‚Äôre exploring how to create a thriving regenerative community locally, connecting our efforts to the broader ReFi network and making sure our initiatives reflect the needs of the local environment and community.
 
 üéôÔ∏è¬†The ReFi Podcast & Beyond
 
 Earlier this year, I had the chance to co-host the ReFi Podcast with Tereza B√≠zkov√°. Leading Season 4 has been a huge opportunity for us to dig deep and tell stories that inspire and educate.
 
 We expanded the season into three focused miniseries under the theme The Regeneration Nexus. We began with the miniseries, The Vision, exploring foundational ideas for rethinking economic and belief systems.
 
 Conversations with thought leaders like John Fullerton on regenerative economics, Samantha Power on bioregionalism, and Glen Weyl on pluralism emphasized common themes: respect for life, interconnectedness, and valuing diversity and indigenous wisdom.
 
 Next, we‚Äôre moving into ‚ÄúThe Practice‚Äù to showcase real-world examples of regeneration and ‚ÄúThe Tools‚Äù to explore how tech like blockchain and AI can help scale these efforts.
 
 So far, we‚Äôve launched five episodes, hosted four Twitter Spaces, and have so much more to come.
 
 Being part of the ReFi community and a proud Regen Citizen over the last four and a half years has been a journey filled with storytelling, collaboration, and exploring new ways to create change.
 
 With your support, I‚Äôm excited to keep sharing these stories and building bridges that matter. Thank you for the opportunity and being part of my journey. üíú",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42220/16/72

 # Impact on Local Communities and Bioregions:
 
 - My events work in Berlin funneled $12k in revenue to Moos Space, a locally-rooted community space for co-living, co-working, events and learning. I co-organized two annual events here called Regens Unite Berlin in 2022 and 2023, where 200 people attended.
 - I co-organized the Regen Village in Brussels 2024, [which kickstarted the Commons Hub](https://x.com/regensunite/status/1813920898963083680): a local innovation hub and coworking space. We funneled $25k in revenue to help this space launch.
 - I am currently co-organizing an event in Bangkok - [New to Web3? Start Here](https://x.com/OrnellaWeb3/status/1839314702385791462) - that is designed to onboard local Thai community to web3. It includes a hands-on experience to learn about regen platforms like Gitcoin & Giveth and discover regenerative communities like Regens Unite.
 
 # Operational Support:
 
 - I have been building [Regens Unite](https://www.regensunite.earth/) as a core team member consistently for over 2 years, an organization dedicated to community growth and education around regeneration. As a small team of 4 we have organized over 18 events across 9 countries, grown a telegram group of over 700+ participants, and kickstarted a permanent innovation hub in Brussels - the Commons Hub.
 - I was previously a core contributor at [Giveth.io](http://Giveth.io) for 12 months, leading the Communications team to help grow user adoption of the platform and increase donations to regenerative projects.
 
 # Education and Growth:
 
 - ‚ÄúFundraising in Web3‚Äù Gitcoin onboarding session at Regens Unite Berlin 2023
  - I invited both newcomers and experienced people to share learnings and ask questions about how to access platforms like Gitcoin to raise funds for impactful projects.

 > Our mission? To revolutionize how donors identify and support grantees during PGF rounds.
 
 **QUICK LINKS**
 - [View the latest implementation of GrantsScope](https://grantsscope.streamlit.app/)
 - [GrantsScope details on prior funding and impact on Karma GAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/grantsscope---grantee-discovery-using-llms)
 
 ### The Challenge: 
 In large PGF rounds, where hundreds of grantees vie for attention, the brightest spotlight often falls on those with the strongest marketing. This imbalance creates a cycle where deserving projects may go unnoticed, leading to an uneven distribution of resources and opportunities.
 
 > Information silos create cultural silos
 
 ### The Result: 
 This disparity not only places additional burdens on grantees to amplify their visibility but also diverts their focus from creating meaningful impact. As a result, the true potential of PGF is left untapped, and innovation in public goods is stifled.
 
 ### Our Solution: GrantsScope
 We believe in leveling the playing field. GrantsScope harnesses the power of data analytics, machine learning, and advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance project visibility and democratize access to funding. Our experiments are designed to assist donors during quadratic funding rounds on Gitcoin Grants by
 - Providing personalized recommendations, helping donors easily navigate the complexity of PGF rounds.
 - Offering self-discovery tools that empower donors to explore and connect with projects that resonate with their values.
 - Reducing information asymmetry, ensuring donors comprehensively understand the PGF landscape.
 
 ### Our Impact:

 ## Problem
 
 In the fragmented world of Web3, users are forced to manage multiple identities across different chains, applications, and social platforms. This leads to a cumbersome user experience, security risks, and hinders the growth of the decentralized ecosystem.
 
 There are so many projects building complicated digital identity products that are focused on privacy. Yet for us it's just a ""[feature](https://github.com/peeramid-labs/multipass/milestone/1)""
 
 The real pain point we identified in ethereum UX is that we need a cross-domain user handle lookup! 
 
 **With multipass dApps are able to answer following questions**
 - _""What's `@Bob.telegram` handle on `discord`""?_
 - _""I just saw an activity by `0xdeadcafee...101` for my dApp, what's handle of user on `discord` ?_
 - _""What's `@Bob.discord` wallet address?_

 # Overview
 
 **ReFi Mediterranean** is focused on catalyzing **Regenerative Finance (ReFi) and Web3** technologies across the Mediterranean bioregion. Rooted in ancient wisdom and modern innovation, we seek to create a unified network of local nodes, organizations, and projects dedicated to addressing the region's ecological, social, and economic challenges. Through collaboration, resource sharing, and impact-driven strategies, we aim to align diverse efforts under a shared vision of bioregional regeneration.
 
 With its unique blend of cultures, landscapes, and histories, the Mediterranean region is both a site of profound challenges and rich opportunities for regeneration. By weaving together the strengths of grassroots movements and cutting-edge digital tools, ReFi Mediterranean will foster a coordinated response to crises such as climate change, rural depopulation, and economic stagnation. Through a phased approach, ReFi Mediterranean will begin by mapping and connecting regenerative finance nodes and assets across the region, eventually scaling toward a comprehensive **Bioregional Regeneration Strategy** and establishing a **Bioregional Financing Facility (BFF)** to support long-term transformation.
 
 # Our Bioregion: A Tapestry of Land, Sea, and Culture
 
 The Mediterranean, often hailed as the cradle of civilization, is a bioregion where history, culture, and nature have been intricately woven together for millennia. The Mediterranean is a complex mosaic, its boundaries defined not by political borders but by the rhythms of nature and shared cultural heritage. Our bioregion encompasses four key areas:
 
 - **West**: The sun-drenched coasts of Portugal, Spain, and southern France.
 - **Central**: The Italian peninsula and the Adriatic shores of Croatia.
 - **East**: The ancient lands of Greece, coastal T√ºrkiye, and the Levant.
 - **South**: The North African coast, stretching from Morocco to Egypt.
 
 At the heart of our bioregion lies the Mediterranean Sea, an azure thread connecting diverse landscapes and cultures. For centuries, it has served as a conduit for trade, exchanging not just goods but ideas, languages, and ways of life. The very essence of Mediterranean culture‚Äîfrom our olive oil and wine to our philosophies and art‚Äîhas been shaped by this intermingling of peoples and traditions.
 
 Today the Mediterranean stands at a crossroads, facing a web of interconnected challenges. Climate collapse, political turmoil, and economic instability have cast long shadows over this once-flourishing bioregion. Mass tourism threatens to turn vibrant local cultures into mere backdrops for vacation photos, while fossil fuel extraction risks transforming the Mediterranean Sea into a gas field and potential conflict zone. The impacts of climate change, including droughts, wildfires, and desertification, are increasingly severe, and political instability in the southern regions has sparked humanitarian crises as people seek safety across treacherous waters. The Mediterranean also contends with bureaucratic inertia, rural depopulation, and the ongoing migration crisis, which further strain the region‚Äôs ecosystems and communities. Industrial agriculture and political borders disrupt the natural interconnectedness of the region, while the Mediterranean Sea suffers from pollution, overfishing, and other environmental pressures.
 
 Yet, within each of these challenges lies the seed of opportunity for regeneration. Communities are banding together to organize reforestation efforts and fire watch activities. The spread of regenerative agriculture and syntropic agroforestry, adapted to the unique Mediterranean climate, offers pathways to heal depleted soils, revitalize rural areas, and create stronger community bonds. We are also witnessing a reverse migration, as people from northern Europe trade their corporate jobs for a slower, sun-soaked lifestyle. This influx is breathing new life into abandoned areas and sparking the creation of innovative ecovillages, like the [Traditional Dream Factory](https://www.traditionaldreamfactory.com/) in Portugal.
 
 While ReFi Mediterranean does not seek to tackle all of the regions challenges at once, it aims to build on our network's strengths and play our part in creating ripples of transformation that lead to systemic change. Our efforts will lay groundwork for a comprehensive [Bioregional Regeneration Strategy](https://www.biofi.earth/activation-guide), guiding the Mediterranean toward a regenerative and resilient future. We seek to unite efforts, weaving together ancient wisdom and cutting-edge technology to form a cohesive network of regeneration. We aim to restore the sacred balance between people, land, and sea, ensuring the Mediterranean becomes a beacon of sustainability and resilience for generations to come.
 
 The essence of our vision: not merely to live the ""sweet life"" (la dolce vita) - for which the Mediterranean is famed - but to build a ""regenerative life"" (**la vita rigenerativa**) that restores balance and harmony to our bioregion.

 The power of ReFi Mediterranean lies in its ability to bring together a diverse network of changemakers, each with their own unique expertise, vision, and connection to place. As we deepen our connections across the bioregion, we are cultivating a movement that is not just about solving immediate crises but about creating long-lasting systems of regeneration.
 
 # Our Vision: Uniting for Bioregional Regeneration
 
 ReFi Mediterranean seeks to connect and scale the efforts of its local ReFi nodes and aligned projects, building on existing regenerative work to create synergies that enhance collaboration and maximize collective impact across the bioregion. Many of the activities listed below are already in progress within local nodes, and the plan is to coordinate and expand these initiatives to deepen their regenerative impact across the Mediterranean.
 
 ### Immediate Focus (Short-Term)
 
 1. **Education, Resource Sharing, and Ecosystem Mapping**: Local nodes are gathering practical resources on ReFi apps, Web3 tools, decentralized governance, and regenerative practices tailored to their specific communities. ReFi Mediterranean will scale these efforts by creating an ecosystem map that highlights ReFi-aligned initiatives across the Mediterranean, connecting local value-driven movements with global tech-enablers. This comprehensive map will serve as a tool for collaboration and broader community education across the bioregion.
 2. **Network Building**: Local nodes are organizing workshops and meetups to foster connections. By coordinating these efforts, ReFi Mediterranean will establish a bioregion-wide network of regenerative projects, strengthening partnerships and facilitating shared learning through conferences and collaborative events.
 3. **Cultural and Spiritual Regeneration**: Local nodes are working to revitalize sacred practices and embed decolonial approaches. ReFi Mediterranean aims to expand these efforts, positioning the Mediterranean as a hub for cultural, spiritual, and agricultural renewal that transcends tourism.
 4. **Storytelling and Amplification**: Many nodes are already capturing and [sharing stories of regeneration.](https://mirror.xyz/0xD49Aaa53caaAc5a44D3b146FD93e4BE885395146) ReFi Mediterranean will scale this work by developing a cohesive multimedia narrative that amplifies local efforts, engages global audiences, and invites wider participation in regenerative initiatives.
 
 ### Building the Foundations (Mid-Term)
 
 1. **Funding and Support**: Participatory mechanisms for fund allocation are already in use by local groups. ReFi Mediterranean aims to scale these processes, facilitating transparent and impactful resource distribution to regenerative projects across the bioregion.
 2. **Data Commons and Ecological Monitoring**: Several nodes are developing systems to track ecological health and monitor regenerative progress. ReFi Mediterranean aims to build on this by creating a shared data infrastructure to aggregate and share this information across the region, supporting informed decision-making and collective impact reporting.
 
 ### Future Horizon (Long-Term)
 
 1. **Regenerative Marketplace and Investment Fund**: Some local nodes are exploring regenerative markets and revenue-sharing models. ReFi Mediterranean aims to establish an on-chain marketplace where regenerative producers can sell their products, with portions of revenues reinvested into community treasuries to support local regeneration.
 2. **Bioregional Investment Fund**: As funding needs grow, ReFi Mediterranean envisions creating a bioregion-wide investment fund to channel larger investments into critical regenerative infrastructure projects, fostering sustainable growth.
 3. **Policy Innovation Lab**: Some nodes are already engaging with policymakers. ReFi Mediterranean aims to scale this by collaborating across the region to pilot innovative governance models that align with bioregional principles, driving systemic change.
 4. **Bioregional Regeneration Strategy & BFF**: Collaborate with other Bioregional Hubs in the region to develop a comprehensive Bioregional Regeneration Strategy that can inform the further development of Bioregional Financing Facilities (BFF) to support long-term regenerative projects and systemic change across the Mediterranean.
 
 By coordinating and scaling these activities, ReFi Mediterranean aims to build a connected, resilient bioregional ecosystem. This network not only addresses immediate challenges but also lays the foundation for long-term pathways to systemic regeneration and renewal. Aligned with the broader Regen Coordination movement, ReFi Mediterranean seeks to develop common infrastructure and alignment across the ecosystem, focusing on the aggregation of impact data from connected organizations. This data will be linked to both local and global funding sources to maximize transparency and effectiveness in resource allocation. As the network expands, ReFi Mediterranean aims to deepen collaboration between local nodes, amplifying shared efforts while building a comprehensive Bioregional Regeneration Strategy. Through this process of mapping, knowledge-sharing, and coordinated resource management, ReFi Mediterranean aspires to create the necessary pathways for scaling regenerative finance across the Mediterranean, fostering systemic change throughout the bioregion.
 
 # Our Finances: Innovating Resource Flows
 
 Our approach to finance is as interconnected as the Mediterranean itself. We're pioneering a nested model of resource management that allows for local autonomy while fostering bioregion-wide collaboration.
 
 ### Current Financial Ecosystem
 
 1. **Local Node Fundraising**: Each node raises funds independently, often through platforms like Gitcoin & ReFi DAO‚Äôs Local Node funding rounds.
 2. **Transparent Distribution**: Funds raised are often redistributed to local projects through open, participatory processes. ReFi Italia has been a leader in this, facilitating collective decision-making on fund allocation. ReFi Barcelona is also experimenting with a Quadratic Funding round for their local network.
 3. **Impact Tracking**: Nodes like RiFai Sicilia and Earthist DAO are using platforms like Bloom Network to write impact reports, earning FLO tokens that can be converted into other cryptocurrencies.
 4. **Yield Generation**: We're learning to manage on-chain treasuries, including strategies for generating yield on idle funds through DeFi protocols.
 
 ### Vision for BioFi Resource Management
 
 As we evolve, we're working towards a more sophisticated, multi-layered financial ecosystem that reimagines where value is placed and how it flows:
 
 1. **Bioregional Treasury**: We're establishing a BioFi Mediterranean multi-sig wallet, with representatives from each local node as signers. This will allow us to manage bioregion-wide resources collectively.
 2. **Nested Governance**: Local nodes will maintain their own treasuries and decision-making processes, nested within the larger bioregional structure. This allows for customized local solutions while enabling coordination on larger initiatives.
 3. **Participatory Allocation**: We're developing mechanisms for participatory budgeting at multiple scales, from local nodes up to the bioregional level.
 4. **Regenerative Cryptoeconomics**: We're exploring the creation of a Mediterranean regenerative token system that could facilitate value exchange across the bioregion while incentivizing regenerative activities.
 5. **Blended Finance Approaches**: We aim to create pathways for traditional finance to support our work, potentially through mechanisms like green bonds or impact investing vehicles tailored to bioregional regeneration.
 6. **Value Reimagination**: Inspired by models such as the [Eight Forms of Capital](http://appleseedpermaculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/8_Forms_of_Capital_PM68.pdf), we're pioneering a shift in how financial value is perceived and allocated. Instead of focusing solely on consumer goods, we're creating mechanisms to direct financial flows towards building regenerative futures, supporting sacred practices, and nurturing love within our communities.
 7. **Cultural Onboarding and Web3 Bridge**: We're developing innovative storytelling approaches to onboard cultural interest in our bioregional regeneration efforts, weaving together ancient Mediterranean mythology with new narratives. We aim to bridge cultural gaps within diverse Mediterranean communities and between traditional and new economies. This includes creating accessible educational materials about blockchain and cryptocurrencies in local languages and dialects, inviting wider participation and financial contributions towards building a thriving future for our bioregion.
 
 # Our Action Plan: A Phased Approach to Transformation
 
 The ambition of ReFi Mediterranean is far-reaching, with the ultimate goal of accelerating a regenerative transition across the bioregion. However, to manage scope effectively and ensure success, a phased approach has been developed, with clear, achievable actions and milestones to guide progress. Given the potential size of the resources raised from this grant application, the primary focus will be on fulfilling Phase 1 of the action plan. This will lay the foundation for further development, with an intention to initiate collaborations and raise additional funding to support subsequent phases.

Explore it now at https://hypercerts.org and see what we‚Äôve built.
 
 > The Hypercerts Foundation pioneers open-source protocols to transparently fund and reward positive impact. Hypercerts are the web3 tools track impactful work, evaluate it and sell its impact.
 
 # Where are we headed
 Imagine a world where positive impact was one of the most highly valued creations in our society; where entrepreneurs who pursued high-uncertainty, high-upside moonshots to radically improve society were rewarded directly for that impact; where becoming a patron of impactful causes was something people aspired to and displayed proudly; and where the methods used to evaluate impact were credible, transparent, and independently verifiable. 
 
 That world might seem a distance away, but it‚Äôs one we can build towards. Specifically we‚Äôd like to see more impact markets, retroactive funding and innovation in the way we fund public goods. In order for this to occur, we need protocols to track and fund impact.
 
 # What are hypercerts? 
 A single hypercert is a semi-fungible token that accounts for work that‚Äôs intended to be impactful, and whose ownership can be fractionalized and even transferred under specific conditions. Each hypercert represents a unique impact claim capturing the following basic information:
 - Who: Set of contributors
 - What: Scope of work
 - When: Time of work
 
 
 ## Avoiding silos ‚Äì interconnected funding system
 As an extension of ERC 1155 semi-fungible tokens, hypercerts create a single, open, shared, and decentralized database for funding mechanisms. This database avoids the creation of new funding silos, as hypercerts can be integrated into any existing funding platform, thereby creating an interconnected funding ecosystem.
 
 ## Selling impact ‚Äì moving beyond donation
 While hypercerts may be useful for any funding mechanism, they‚Äôre particularly valuable for retroactive funding as they provide baseline invariant guarantees that impact claims will not be forgotten. Projects create and sell impact, building financially sustainable and scalable revenue models. With hypercerts, we move beyond donations.
 
 ## Certifying impact ‚Äì open evaluation system
 Certifying impact is a process, and it should be an open and dynamic one. Hence, with hypercerts we create the foundation for an open evaluation system for credible and transparent impact assessment. Every hypercert can receive multiple evaluations from different evaluators using a variety of methodologies. This creates incentives to innovate evaluation methodologies and builds trust.
 
 # Where do we go from here
 Looking ahead, we aim to expand to more chains, enable evaluations with existing and new tools, enhance visualization with hyperboards, create marketplace tools, and collaborate for broader integration. With your support and a growing network, we're building a transparent interconnected funding ecosystem for positive impact.
 
 # The work so far

GG22,GG22 OSS - dApps and Apps,Collabberry,0x37df7945dBE5ec131987e8fa5547FEf048173901,https://twitter.com/collabberry,https://github.com/collabberry,Collabberry,https://collabberry.xyz,APPROVED,"Compensation empowering Collaboration
 
 Collabberry was born out of the Fellowship program of RnDAO and Arbitrum, where we did an extensive research on the problem-space of Compensation in early stage teams. More info about the program here : https://www.rndao.io/colab/fellowship
 
 Compensation in centralized organizations is tricky, and even trickier in decentralized ones, embracing collaboration. 
 
 To achieve a collaborative environment, we need to align incentives in the team. Web3 has been exploring that since its beginning and yet, we still don't have a tool that covers the needs of an early-stage team. 
 
 Early-stage teams struggle to maximize their runway while attracting talent and building a strong team to deliver on a common goal. 
 
 Contributors seek recognition and rewards (oftentimes in ownership) according to their contributions to the project. Contributors are often frustrated with the lack of financial distribution and ownership and they feel discomfort negotiating their salaries. Furthermore, compensation based on negotiation, often results in unfairness, as not everyone has the skill set to do that.
 
 The founders, on the other hand, struggle to form the team as they are not in a place to give competitive salaries.
 
 The solution requires to be:
 * leveraging transparency in compensation for fostering trust and equality
 * harnessing collective intelligence through peer-to-peer assessment
 * implementing a concept of Basic Income for meeting contributors' needs
 * embracing co-ownership to align incentives
 * leveraging Web3 technology for enhanced trust and fairness
 
 This is how we designed Collabberry. 
 
 Collabberry leverages peer-to-peer assessment and dynamic ownership to create fair, transparent, and efficient compensation models for startups and early-stage projects.
 
 Collabberry simplifies collaboration with three key steps: agreement setup, peer-to-peer assessment, and dynamic compensation, split between Team Points for tracking ownership and monetary compensation, ensuring that the contributor's basic needs are covered.
 
 This innovative approach makes Collabberry an essential tool for equitable teamwork.

 gm and welcome
 
 I am Scott Morris, aka @TheTokenJedi
 
 Some know me, many don't, so before I do a lil a speedrun de moi I'd just like to say it's an honor and pleasure to join the many PUBLIC GREATS here in this round. It's really nice to see those doing often unappreciated work getting the recognition they deserve, funding flows aside. Special props to Izzy | @decentalizedceo for taking initiative and to the rest of the team for making it possible! 
 
 Before I go any further, a somber moment for our common humanity: This may seem counterintuitive here but for a moment forget about me and please go donate to [the Sameer project](https://linktr.ee/thesameerproject), a Palestinian led project supporting the people in Gaza. Any god worth praying to knows they need the help more than anyone else right now. Free Palestine! 
 
 With that, here's that speedrun on --*record scratch*-- how I ended up in this situation. Cue the montage! 
 
 It was in 2009 that I first heard about Bitcoin while I was organizing my first local currency experiment: The HERO Rewards program. 
 
 In 2010 and 2012 we ran our first pilots and were lucky enough to be filmed for the [Money & Life documentary](https://youtu.be/OL5xyoD_P6A?si=yxsYm7rDVhUA_o1Y), featuring incredible luminaries like Bernard Lietaer, Hazel Henderson, Riane Eisler, John Fullerton, Charles Eisenstein, and so many more. 
 
 In 2013 I attended my first conference on complementary currencies in The Hague, hosted by RAMICS and Qoin among some other European partners. 
 
 In 2014 I gave a TEDx talk ya'll might enjoy entitled [""Putting People and Planet before Paper Wealth""]( bit.ly/CSMTedx)
 
 In 2015 I launched ""Ithacash -- money made for main st."" and its ""Ithaca Dollars -- i$"" as the successor to the Ithaca HOURs currency in Ithaca NY (1991-2009); and in the course of organizing a Hunger Games themed scavenger hunt with businesses downtown that year initiated a Pay It Forward program that later [won the City of Ithaca a $50k prize](https://www.downtownithaca.com/city-of-ithaca-to-receive-50000-communitywins-award/). 
 
 In 2016 I was part of a hackathon team that won a genuine honorable mention by putting a union on Ethereum and pitching it as a solution for vulnerable gig workers.
 
 In 2017, after initially meeting the team through my work on Ithacash, I supported Bancor's historic, world record setting ITO, where it raised $153M talking about how ""smart tokens"" (the primitives of DeFi we refer to as ""Automated Market Makers"" or ""Bonding Curves"" today) would create liquidity for smaller tokens like community currencies. This performance was due in large part to their having the support of the late great [Bernard Lietaer](https://bernard-lietaer.org/), the advisor and mentor of mine I helped recruit to the project on top of rewriting the original whitepaper with his help. By the way, if you get the feeling I'm making something of a point here it's because I am. 
 
 in 2018, I was invited by longtime MMT champion and now Professor Rohan Grey to join him in teaching some courses at Cornell Law under Prof. Robert Hockett, whom I would come to learn was also co-author of the Green New Deal. Ya'll've heard of that thing yeah? Good stuff.
 
 In 2019, I was focused on helping reinvent Qoin as a crypto-friendly foundation and attended the Bancor-organized event commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Bretton Woods monetary agreement, where I helped co-organize the participant-led working groups track and put forward a vision for a ""Global Impact Alliance"" to catalyze the kinds of multi-stakeholder coalitions necessary for that ""more beautiful world our hearts know is possible"" to again borrow from our dear Charles Eisenstein.
 
 By 2020 though, I was ""cooked"" as the kids say. As in, *super* burnt out; basically useless work wise and in dire need of time to recover and heal. Good thing nothing particularly bad or stressful happened that year right? 
 
 In 2021 I left the US to become a digital nomad and found myself out in Austria at an event called the Crypto Commons Gathering where I met another particularly wonderful group of humans. Especially if you're looking for a cool venue for your next hackathon, retreat etc, come check out the [Commons Hub](https://commons-hub.at/) sometime! P.s. that's where my cover image was taken, courtesy of my epic wingman Jeff Emmett.
 
 Speaking of whom, in 2022 Jeff and I had the original inspiration for ""MycoFi"" there at the hub during an event on Collaborative Finance (CoFi) as a way of helping people advance their thinking about new resource allocation / coordination systems in a more nature-attuned way. If you haven't read the book yet, check it out at https://mycofi.art! Special thanks go to Owocki and Jessica Zartler for their invaluable support bringing that little gem out to the world!
 
 More recently alongside a handful of other projects I've been working with ReFi DAO, with special focus on the DAO-ification working group and the Local Node Network where we hosted a Beta cohort of the Local Node Incubator earlier this year. I tried to bring as much knowledge as I could to the content plan / curriculum based on my earlier days in the trenches doing face to face community organizing; hopefully some of it was instructive.
 
 That explains how I wound up *here, here* at least to some degree. Anyway, what were the prompts again? Oh right, well I hope whatever it was I was talking about said something about that stuff. 
 
 Got some Jedi business? You know how to [find me](https://linktr.ee/thetokenjedi).

 Spark Ecosystems builds tools for impact evaluation and certification. We believe in the Impact=Profit meme. We are currently building a new tool to help projects use the Ecological Benefits Framework to measure their impact.
 
 Our suite of tools includes Deresy, a decentralized review system that provides an evaluation layer for Hypercerts impact claims. Deresy allows 3rd party reviewers to generate attestations on EAS. We also developed Hyperminter is a project in collaboration with Hypercerts that allows gitcoin grantees to easily mint hypercerts for their project after each round. Our newest tool is ImpactScribe which utilizes account abstraction to allow any user to fill out our question set and then the data is stored on IPFS and an attestation is generated on EAS.
 
 ## [ImpactScribe](https://impactscribe.xyz/) | [GitHub UI](https://github.com/chimi-co/ebf-ui) | [GitHub api](https://github.com/chimi-co/ebf-api) 
 We have developed an MVP of the tool that allows any project making a positive impact in the world to generate an Ecological Benefits Framework (EBF) Impact certificate, Impact report, and a digital fingerprint. This project is being built in collaboration with the Lexicon, ebfcommon.org and ReFi DAO to create a prototype tool that helps projects utilize the EBF framework. 
 We incorporate account abstraction so that users only need an email to create an account, and a wallet will be generated for them. After answering a set of questions, the user will submit them, and the data is stored on IPFS and an attestation will be generated onchain. The user does not have to sign any transactions and the gas is paid by the tool. The MVP is an experiment in building a web3 tool with web2 accessibility. The tool will be useful for any public goods project working with IRL communities that have yet to be onboarded to web3.

 ## [Deresy](https://deresy.xyz) | [GitHub](https://github.com/chimi-co)
 A Decentralized Review System. We launched v1 of the tool over a year ago to review Gitcoin grants from the old cGrants platform directly. We recently launched v2, which integrates with Hypercerts and generates attestations on EAS. The tool allows any round operator or funder to conduct 3rd party reviews of Hypercert impact claims.

 ## [Hyperminter](https://hyperminter.xyz) | [GitHub](https://github.com/ImpactScribe/hypercert-ledger)
 This is the first third-party UI for minting Hypercerts for Gitcoin grants. The tool connects to the Gitcoin indexer and pre-fills a form with grantee data after a grant round. This includes an allowlist of donors who have donated to the project during the round. The grantee then edits the form and mints a Hypercert. This was previously a manual process conducted by Gitcoin and the Hypercerts team. Now, grantees can use the self-serve tool to mint a Hypercert for any grant.
 
 
 
 
 ## Road Map
 Your support will help fund our work on ImpactScribe. Our next sprint will include analyzing the data produced in the first sprint and generating onchain impact reports and EBF fingerprints. We are developing this project in collaboration with ReFi DAO and the Lexicon. The next development sprint will focus on using LLMs to synthesize the data collected into an Impact Report and EBF fingerprint.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/608/83

 The main features and functionalities are that it is built using smart contracts and deployed on a blockchain so that there is immutable yet transparent traceability both for data and IP. It acts as a publicly accessible registry and builds on the direct object identifier system (persistent object identifier) in that it adds blockchain transaction hash traceability and IPFS (interplanetary file sharing) data pointers. Its current and most updated MVP iteration has an MIT license github repo. The original release of January 2023 still has a private repo, both held under the same account owner on Github (Paige Donner). 
 
 
 #The project's current focus is to uplevel the existing MVP with more functionalities which also include AI integrations.

 ## Further details about Frontier Registry and how it meets the grant eligibility requirements:
 
 *FrontierRegistry is the science publishing data management platform we‚Äôve built to Alpha release that integrates blockchain technology for IP traceability, and AI for provenance and accessibility. 
 
 * With catalytic scientific research innovation tools like AI, quantum computing (such as the one used at Oak Ridge Federal Lab in Tennessee and El Capitan at Lawrence Livermore Labs), and Machine Learning, we believe that innovations in STEM research, especially of these transformative technologies like fusion energy and biopharmaceuticals, will come much more rapidly. 
 
 BUT, we must have the research infrastructure - the systems - in place that allow for Fairness - open, accessible collaboration and thus rapid-fire iterations and improvements, while also protecting Freedom - the ‚ÄòLego Building Blocks‚Äô of individual researchers‚Äô Intellectual Property. 
 
 Frontier Registry - protects Freedom of scientific research by providing the necessary infrastructure to authenticate provenance and ownership of Intellectual Property. In this way it addresses the SFF objective for Freedom: Ensuring the continuation of other individual liberties such as privacy, private property, and freedom of association.
 
 Frontier Registry - provides for Fairness of scientific research and collaboration by providing a means for open access *to and of *research and the implementation of Open Science through accessibility of data. By facilitating open information sharing, the tool provides the levers of accessibility for underserved and underrepresented populations within the global research community both during the research process and once the data is produced and released for review. In this way, Frontier Registry addresses the SFF Fairness objective: Fostering and demanding inclusivity and diversity of representation in access to AI technologies, and benefits from AI-enabled services.
 
 When these issues, as well as the politicization of funding sources and agendas for pre-ordained research outcomes, are systems engineered against and de-risked, will we have a global scientific research culture that allows for transformative technologies, such as fusion energy, to take its rightful place on this planet and be used for the good of all and not just the enrichment and enjoyment of a few.
 
 We must also responsibly, and with enforceable commitment, leverage against the ‚Äòextinction level event‚Äô that general artificial intelligence could impose on humanity. ‚ÄòThe most dangerous thing you can do with AI is to let it write code,‚Äô is a line from the Doc, Don‚Äôt Look Up. So what happens when AI is unleashed on a large scale into scientific research practices? 
 
 FrontierRegistry is positioned as a tool that has responsibility and ethical conduct engineered into its structure. At a minimum, it allows for traceability, transparency and reproducibility of research including whether, if and when that research is AI generated.
 
 With FrontierRegistry, our open source, on-chain platform for scientific and engineering data provenance, research and IP authentication, we are providing the solution to bottlenecked research getting published in a timely and accessible way, while still protecting individual researchers‚Äô IP rights. 
 
 FrontierRegistry‚Äôs business model is for licensing at enterprise and government level with per user variables. For individual users we offer Freemium and subscription plans on a sliding scale, for users who might be in economically disadvantaged regions.

 * **Digital cooperative legal structure** - Combining a traditional legal structure with web3 rails to reward impact creators and funders with rights to the org‚Äôs future cash flows (in a transparent, compliant way‚Äîüëã, Gensler)
 
 Our flagship product, Streaming Quadratic Funding (SQF), brings the free-rider-incentive-busting quadratic funding mechanism to a real-time, continuous form. With SQF...
 
 * Public good builders **earn sustainable funding** by delivering on their mission‚Äîfewer distractions hunting/shilling grants and more focus on growing impact and cultivating long-term supporter relationships.
 * Donors **make high-conviction funding decisions** where and when they find something they care about rather than in chaotic, time-constrained voting periods. Think of it like a QF-supercharged Patreon where supporters invest in future value creation rather than providing one-off charity.
 * Ecosystems **attract, retain, and amplify talent.** No one likes funding uncertainty, administrative delays, or capital inefficiency. Streaming grants are a competitive advantage on both sides of the impact funding equation.

GG22,Regen Citizens Genesis,Leen Schelfhout - creating and holding space for regens to unite,0xF9903c5d11E8f4bFebcf02747D53319E9c4a10c6,https://twitter.com/leen_schelfhout,https://github.com/,Leen Schelfhout - creating and holding space for regens to unite,https://regensunite.earth,APPROVED,"# Who am I?
 
 Apart from being a mom, a runner, and someone torn between the city and nature (how does one choose?), I seem to naturally create and hold space wherever I go‚Äîfor warm human connections and deeper democracy, guided by care, intention, and a deep belief that community is immunity.
 
 Life being full of surprises, I stumbled into web3 in 2020. At first, I was a bit skeptical, but soon found myself blown away by its dynamic world of opportunity and hope. I dove right in. Being lead of the All for Climate DAO team in that same year, we guided the collectives we support into the Gitcoin ecosystem to help them find more backing for their grassroots, locally-rooted projects. I also joined Gravity DAO (and TEC) and started offering deep democracy workshops and trainings in various settings and for several DAOs.
 
 As I became more aware of the differing views between climate and social justice activists and web3 builders on the role of technology in driving systemic change, I was inspired to organize and facilitate the first Regens Unite event in Brussels in 2022. The venue was a neighborhood building we had established in 2021‚Äîan ideal place for fostering unity. Rooted locally, united globally.
 
 Since 2020, I‚Äôve been both learning and contributing in the web3 space with growing curiosity and belief that we‚Äôre onto something. We‚Äôre building solutions, iterating, and staying close to the critical questions: What else is possible when we create new systems that honor our planet?
 
 # What have I contributed?
 
 Supporting local communities is in the core of the work I do, whether that is creating space for uniting with globally connected communities via Regens Unite, starting local community buildings (Citizen Corner and Commons Hub), facilitating online and in real life circles (from women circles to regenerative finance circles) or doing local regen projects (rewilding city projects like the Citizen Garden)

 ## Impact on Local Communities and Bioregions
 A non-exhaustive glimpse of impact on local communities
 - The Regens Events in Brussels made a significant positive impression on our neighbors, enhancing the reputation of web3 and technology. Hosting the two RU events in the Citizen Corner‚Äîa hyper-local 'doorstep' project‚Äîwhile experimenting with a token system in the building, gave our neighbors a chance to meet builders and bring these 'tech builders' into their everyday world.
 - All Regens Unite events, whether in Brussels, in Berlin, or in London, were held in value-aligned community spaces, bringing funding and networks to these locations. A concrete example: Regen Village in Brussels 2024 raised ‚Ç¨25k for the Commons Hub Brussels, an innovation hub and coworking space we launched this year, funneling $25k in revenue to kickstart the space.
 - At the Commons Hub Brussels, we‚Äôre experimenting with a fully onchain local economy, integrating both yin and yang economies: EUR for running a space in a competitive (yang) market, and Commons HUB Tokens (yin) to reward community work.
 
 ## Some of the operational support I have been offering:
 - Executive Director of All for Climate DAO for 4 years (2019-2023), building a network of over 250 grassroots climate and social justice projects across Europe, with some in Africa. A highlight: onboarding Ayowecca into web3 and helping them succeed in their first Gitcoin round. They are still very active in the community and are building beautiful projects.
 - Building Regens Unite for the past 2.5 years into a dynamic, globally connected community of regens. We‚Äôre a small team of 4, but we have organized over 18 events across 9 countries, growing a Telegram group of 700+ participants, and we launched the permanent innovation hub in Brussels, the Commons Hub.
 - I co-founded two community buildings and am currently the driving force behind the [Commons Hub Brussels] (https://commonshub.brussels, where we hosted Regen Village in July 2024.
 
 # Why I am participating in this round
 
 Because I need support. I am a natural community builder. I do not build tech, I focus on relationships and on building the warm welcoming spaces we need for sinking deeper into human being, and less into human doing. To keep going, to keep sparking and holding spaces, I can use your support, as an acknowledgement for bringing a yin voice in a yang world.

 ![Jobstash](https://i.imgur.com/Yvuz0Jd.png)
 
 JobStash is a job platform which indexes and publishes jobs for over 1500 organizations which are currently hiring. We distribute job vacancy data throughout the ecosystem, and each month we serve 40k pageviews, 4k job applications sent, and 1k unique job applicants.
 
 Our core value proposition is that we are the fastest jobsite in the space when it comes to discovering jobs, and we structure the job vacancy data so it can be easily evaluated, filtered and sorted by our end users and integrators.
 
 We are fully independent, bootstrapped, and support DeFi protocols, networks, and other onchain and offchain projects in need of staff.
 
 ## Our Impact
 
 - Served 300k pageviews on jobstash.xyz
 - 29k unique users applied for a job
 - 41k vacancies received candidates from us
 
 ## JobStash: Quick intro
 
 Crypto is permissionless. As such, we discover job data for reputable decentralized on-chain and off-chain organizations without any interaction on their side. Most organizations dont know we exist, because we don't force our users to mention us, and we have no incentives do to so.
 Simply put: we are the best friend of small nascent organizations which don't yet have the capacity to run an in-house recruitment department.
 We've been growing steadily and with great attention to the quality of our dataset, and our value is that we don't gatekeep information between candidates and organizations. 
 We provide tools and information for both candidates and employers to optimally identify suitable opportunities, contributing to the growth of the crypto ecosystem.
 The core focus of the project is on data collection, structuring of data, enrichment, and correlation between market data and job data.
 We present projects and organizations in a complete, permanent and authoritative way by showing critical metrics such as TVLs, Hacks, Raises, Usage stats, and more. We allow protocol members to join the platform for free and redact inaccuracies and enrich the data set with their own knowledge.
 
 We provide this data to the ecosystem via an open API, which then allows other builders to compose solutions leveraging our data silos.
 
 ## Our advantage
 
 Our platform is fully automated and ingests data from APIs and via custom AI based scraping infrastructure we built bespoke for JobStash.
 We currently have ¬±8k subscribers in our telegram channel, and try to keep the quality of our subscribers high.
 Our fully automated platform which requires no manual input from organizations to list their jobs, and which allows consenting developers to opt in and have their opensource public contributions analyzed and ranked to solve safety and trust issues which commonly plague sourcing departments at organizations.
 
 ## Problems We Are Addressing
 
 - Fragmented job market due to misaligned monetary incentives for publishing job ads, similar to liquidity fragmentation across various L1s/L2s.
 - Job vacancy liveness: our tooling is the fastest on the internet when it comes to discovering new open roles in the crypto industry, ensuring our users have the best odds of having their candidacy evaluated.
 - External recruitment agencies not acting in the best interest of candidates or organizations, leading to suboptimal matchmaking.
 - Limited access to detailed information about crypto job opportunities due to information gatekeeping.
 - Difficulty in identifying the most relevant and high-potential job openings in a rapidly evolving space.
 
 ## Solutions We Implemented
 
 - A free, fully automated and unbiased platform that aggregates job listings from reputable crypto organizations.
 - Innovative condensation of job ads into information-dense, optimally formatted job-ads.
 - Building tools for both job takers and job offerers to streamline their processes
 - Providing detailed data about job opportunities to individual candidates.
 - Offering analytics and research to gain insights into the general crypto job market.
 
 ## End-User Value
 
 Our platform aims to place the right people in the right job as efficiently as possible by providing the best and most up-to-date information. This enables all parties to independently make informed decisions throughout the job application process, ultimately contributing to the growth and success of the entire crypto ecosystem.
 
 ## Goals
 
 - Continuously improve our Web UI and data pipelines. We spent 2 years building this project, and will continue doing so as long as we can.
 - Integrate more job sources and onboard additional organizations and projects.
 - Integrate additional sources of data for better understanding of evaluated opportunities.
 
 ## Team Information
 
 Our diverse, global team consists of four full-time members and two part-time contributors (5 devs and 1 designer), with plans to expand soon.
 David Leonardi, an engineer passionate about building projects benefiting makers and builders, founded the project in September 2022.
 
 ## Source of Funds
 
 Grants have been an instrumental source of funding for our project.
 We are prod to have been supported by RetroPGF3, but these funds are coming to and end this month, and we need more to keep building
 
 ## Use of Funds
 
 Funds received will cover infrastructure bills and support our engineers in working full-time without external influences. Our costs include GitHub, OpenAI, Figma, hosting, and various software vendor licenses. We aim to compensate our contributors fairly, considering living costs in their regions across Europe, Southeast Asia, and Africa.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/608/87

 To use tokens in decentralised applications such as Uniswap you have to grant the application permission to spend tokens on your behalf - known as a token approval. Token approvals are an important part of using these apps, but can be dangerous if left unchecked.
 
 Bugs can exists and exploits can happen even in established projects, and by granting token approvals you are potentially exposing your wallet to these exploits. To keep yourself safe from exploits it is a good practice to regularly inspect and revoke your approvals.
 
 Revoke.cash comes in as a preventative tool to manage your token approvals and practice proper wallet hygiene. By regularly revoking active approvals you reduce the chances of becoming the victim of exploits.
 
 In many cases, phishing websites try to make you sign an approval while they pretend to be an NFT mint or other legitimate use cases. When these phishing scams happen, it is recommended to use Revoke.cash to mitigate the damage, but it is even better to prevent the scam in the first place.
 
 This is where the Revoke.cash Browser Extension comes in. The extension pops up whenever you are about to sign an approval and will inform you of the approval's details. This can help you prevent signing malicious approvals.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/608/89

It is a Rust-based solidity smart contract static analyzer designed to help protocol engineers and security researchers find vulnerabilities in Solidity code bases.
 
 Aderyn integrates seamlessly into small and enterprise-level development workflows. It offers lightning-fast, command-line, static analysis functionality and a framework for building custom detectors that adapt to any Solidity codebase.
 
 
 ### Aderyn does three things really well:‚Äç‚Äç‚Äç
 
 * Identify Solidity Smart contract vulnerabilities: Cyfrin Aderyn quickly identifies potential vulnerabilities in Solidity code and highlights parts of the codebase for further investigation.
 
 * Supports building custom detectors to suit your needs: Protocols and security researchers can use the Cyfrin Aderyn framework to build custom vulnerability detectors for any Solidity codebase.
 
 * Identify known issues and protect your value: Competitive auditing platforms can use Cyfrin Aderyn to detect and filter out known issues inside protocol codebases, protecting customers' and auditors' time and value.
 
 
 ## Who is it for?
 ### 1. Developers
 
 As a new generation of developers enters the space, we (the security community) are responsible for using our knowledge and experience to create tools that facilitate secure development practices. We need to make it easy to avoid repeating past mistakes.
 
 From a developer's perspective, the cost of finding bugs in Solidity code is exorbitantly high. Engaging top-tier security firms like Cyfrin Private Audits or competitive audit platforms like CodeHawks requires serious cash. That's because the security knowledge required to stamp out bugs is pooled among security firms and competitive auditors, who are in demand.
 
 We must drive the cost of finding bugs, especially the common and known ones, towards zero by creating tools that make development secure by nature.
 
 Aderyn is built for lightning-fast, open-source static analysis that hooks into the existing development workflow. 
 
 
 ### 2. Security Researchers
 
 Security Researchers are the knowledge guardians of the on-chain world. They are the people you engage with when you're undergoing an audit. Many auditors start every audit with a long checklist. They read through the codebase, ensuring the code doesn't violate any items on their list. If it does, it's an issue for the report. Once they've finished with this list, they get creative and try out other techniques.
 
 Aderyn's detector framework enables Security Researchers to encode the patterns they look for in their checklist into Aderyn detectors. By doing this, the research community can focus on the deeper, more complex bugs, knowing that tooling has uncovered the repetitive checklist of issues so they don't have to.
 
 Developers write more secure code before they engage Security Researchers, and when they do, the Researchers can spend more time on complex bugs instead of manually checking for easy fixes. 
 
 
 ## What makes Aderyn unique vs similar tools?
 
 * Speed: Real-time feedback as you‚Äôre coding with the upcoming vscode extension.
 
 * Cutting-edge detectors: The detectors are built from the latest findings from external and in-house auditors. This means developers can harness the power of an audit team at their fingertips for free!
 
 * ‚ÄúAuditor Mode‚Äù: Helps auditors find specific areas and concepts within a codebase to dig further. For example, ‚ÄúShow me all of the instances in which this storage slot is altered‚Äù.
 
 * Open-source: This tool is completely open-source and will be free for all developers in perpetuity. Cyfrin does not make money directly from it.

 ## About
 In the heart of Tororo, Eastern Uganda, a crisis of environmental degradation threatens the region's biodiversity and agricultural productivity. Rampant deforestation and wetland destruction have led to irreversible damage, impacting the livelihoods of local
 communities. Our proposed solution aims to restore the natural landscapes through community awareness campaigns and large-scale tree planting efforts. By addressing the lack of awareness and engaging communities in restoration efforts, we can
 create a sustainable shift towards conservation practices.
 
 Our project's goals include planting 1 million native trees, rehabilitating 100 hectares of wetlands, and increasing environmental conservation awareness among 80% of the local population. We are committed to reversing the tide of environmental degradation in Tororo and fostering a culture of conservation for generations to come. 
 
 **AYOWECCA UGANDA‚Äôs** wide range of programs provide support in some of the poorest and most underprivileged communities in Uganda, East Africa. We work with wetlands, peatlands and ecosystem restoration to help address climate change; we also plant fruit trees in schools, health centers and communities to fight food insecurity, increase plantations and provide forest cover.
 Besides agroforestry/permaculture, plastic wastes and management and energy conservation, **AYOWECCA UGANDA** also trains young adolescent girls on how to make reusable sanitary towels and provides scholastic materials to the most vulnerable to attend and access education and creates awareness among communities to actively empower women and children.
 Since AYOWECCA UGANDA is community founded, our activities are community based to benefit the local people facing both social and environmental challenges.

 Partnerships, Community Engagement & Governance üèõÔ∏è
 ---------------------------------------------------
 
 Let's be honest. We like DAOs.. and community, and carrots. ü•ï Some people call us sheep üêë. Do sheep like carrots? Not sure, but we have some serious decentralization and governance jingle bells going on.
 
 Closer's governance model is built on DAOs, enabling decentralized decision-making through Proof of Presence and Proof of Sweat. These systems ensure that members gain governance influence based on time spent in the community and contributions made. Native Tokens incentivize participation, and communities can easily adopt these tools, fostering transparency and equity in village operations.
 
 We are very grateful to have partnerships with a great ecosystem of infrastructure partners including:
 
 - Inverter
 
 - Celo
 
 We also have implemented strategic collaborations with well technical partners such as:
 
 - DarkMatter\
 And our token system can be integrated in a typical DAO stack such as:
 
 - Charmverse
 
 - Snapshot
 
 And our projects often track ecosystem services provided through:
 
 - Open Forest Protocol
 
 - SimplexDNA (coming soon)
 
 We are working with a number of distribution partners to support the growth the events and communities in our ecosystem including:
 
 - ReFi DAO
 
 - Regen Tribe
 
 - Agartha
 
 - re:build¬†
 
 - Gathering of Tribes

 We have received previous funding from the following sources:
 
 - ‚Ç¨50k from Climate Collective
 
 - ‚Ç¨50k from Regen Network
 
 - ‚Ç¨10k from Gitcoin donors + match funding
 
 Closer generates revenue through onboarding fees and a percentage of sales from bookings for guests, volunteers, and events. These recurring income streams are complemented by village-operated Native Tokens for internal economies. As the platform evolves, Closer will fully tokenize as a DAO, enabling decentralized funding and investment for long-term growth.
 
 We currently have successfully onboarded four land-based communities including TDF in Portugal, Leos in Poland, Moos in Berlin and Foz in Portugal. They are all actively using the platform to manage guests and operations.

 Closer provides a next-gen platform that enables planet positive land-based communities - and possible exits to the commons. It is an open source decentralized platform for co-owned regenerative villages, transforming them into socioeconomic hubs through both Web2 and Web3 tools. Villages use the platform to onboard guests, volunteers, and events, while adopting blockchain-based tools like Native Tokens, Proof of Presence, and Proof of Sweat for governance and resource management. This hybrid approach empowers communities to scale sustainable practices, foster collaboration, and restore ecosystems, while transitioning seamlessly from traditional systems to decentralized governance.
 
 We are seeking to¬† raise funds on Gitcoin via the dApps and Apps round to fund further open source software development focusing on our ""Proof Presence"" protocol v2.0 which will enable us to onboard the next generation of regenerative villages and scale the regenerative movement through place-based communities.

 The Problem of Land-Based Communities üò´
 ----------------------------------------
 
 Regenerative villages struggle with inefficient resource management, centralized governance, and financial instability. These challenges hinder scaling and sustainable growth. Closer offers decentralized governance via Native Tokens, Proof of Presence, and Proof of Sweat, incentivizing active participation and transparent resource management. The platform enables non-Web3 villages to digitize their operations, paving the way for scalable, community-led ecological restoration.
 
 Decentralized governance ensures that villages are self-managed, responsive, and adaptive, promoting long-term sustainability while allowing local decision-making to drive restoration efforts.
 
 Yalla, LFG regens.
 
 What is ""Proof of Presence""? üèïÔ∏è
 --------------------------------
 
 Proof of Presence is our game-changing feature that tracks and rewards your active participation within a community. The more time you spend, the more Presence you collect, and the more influence you have in decision-making. It's your passport to a richer, more connected community experience.

 What is ""Proof of Sweat""? üòÖ
 ----------------------------
 
 Proof of Sweat is an innovative approach that rewards members for their active contributions to a project. By quantifying the work and effort put in, it grants members greater influence and recognition within the community. This system ensures that the more you contribute, the more impact you have, fostering a more engaged and productive environment.¬†
 
 Here's how it all fits into the bigger picture of web3 access, governance, housing & infrastructure and natural capital assets (for all you forest lovers). üå≤

 Instead of having to keep track of long hexadecimal addresses, simply right-click an address and give it a memorable label. Now when you go to any web page, the extension automatically replaces that address wherever it appears with the label you provided. **This makes understanding onchain activity way easier, and it works on any website and any blockchain!**
 
 ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rolod0x/rolod0x/main/docs/images/promo/right-click.jpg)
 
 You can also quickly look up any address by pressing a hotkey, and then just type part of what you're looking for.

 From the settings page you can see your whole address book in one place. To protect your privacy, it's stored locally in your browser, so it never leaves your device. It's just plain text which is easy to edit, and you can export and import addresses from anywhere simply with copy and paste.

 rolod0x is [Free and Open Source software][license]. All code has been done by one person over the last two years for free. There are many exciting plans for improvement listed in [the GitHub project][future], including:
 
 - [adding support for dividing the address book into multiple sections][sections],
 - [automatic import of address book entries from URLs][URL-import] specified by the user,
 - [integration with the Rotki portfolio manager][rotki] (a long-time recipient of Gitcoin Grants), and other wallets,
 - [creating a standardized address book format][format] for [interoperability][] across web3, and
 - polishing of various elements of the user experience.
 
 The full roadmap is listed at <https://github.com/users/aspiers/projects/2/views/2>.
 
 There are no plans to monetize rolod0x. It was built as a public good to improve web3 UX and therefore help scale web3 adoption.
 
 **However without funding, any significant further development is simply not sustainable.**
 
 So your support for this project would be hugely appreciated. Thanks for reading!

 We cover data for hundreds of grant programs, and quantify their impact on the ecosystem.
 Our handy AI grant finder allows to find a suitable grant program for everyone's project.
 
 ![Ecosystem Vision](https://i.imgur.com/Bq3Ce96.png)
 
 Ecosystem Vision is a project built by the JobStash.xyz team in collaboration with members of the Cartographer Syndicate. Its aim is to index every organization, project and source of funding in the ecosystem, along with providing metrics and verified data about organizations, ethereum alignment, and verified staff.
 
 We leverage data accumulated by JobStash about 6500+ organizations and 3000+ projects, and just got started with this new project.
 
 We are fully independent, bootstrapped, and support DeFi protocols, networks, and other onchain and offchain projects in need of staff.
 
 ## Our Goals
 
 - Ecosystem Vision is an aggregator. We aim to aggregate as much data about the ecosystem as we can.
 - Become the default source of funding (both grants and VC) information across the ecosystem
 - Become a beacon of ethereum alignment metrics across the ecosystem
 
 ## Our advantage
 
 We have been building aggregators for two years, and want to leverage the unique data we have amassed through our lifetime. 
 We have an audience of 8000 subscribers willing to engage, and have built a reputation for being a neutral organization building projects that are useful for the community.
 
 ## Problems We Are Addressing
 
 - Lack of clarity over which grant programs are currently accepting grantees
 - Lack of easily accessible and aggregated impact metrics for projects
 - Lack of verifiable contact points at organizations in the space (too many scams..)
 
 ## Solutions We Implemented
 
 - We aggregated all grant programs from Karma GAP
 - We aggregated funding impact from OpenSource Observer
 - Built an AI grant finder based on data of over 250 grant programs
 - A full list of 6500 organizations active in crypto
 - A list of ¬±4000 projects active in crypto
 
 ![AI Grant Finder](https://i.imgur.com/fYTTTKV.png)
 
 
 ## End-User Value
 
 Our platform aims to support founders wishing to find funding in the ecosystem and to conduct business with trustworthy counterparties. 
 
 ## Goals
 
 - Continuously improve our UI and data pipelines. We spent 2 years building JobStash, and will commit to building Ecosystem Vision doing so as long as we can.
 - Integrate more data sources and onboard additional organizations and projects.
 - Integrate additional sources of funding data for better understanding of evaluated opportunities.
 - Build ZK proving for verifiable data
 - Build metrics around ethereum alignment for projects we index as per Vitalik's latest post
 
 ## Team Information
 
 Our diverse, global team consists of four full-time members and two part-time contributors (5 devs and 1 designer), with plans to expand soon.
 David Leonardi, an engineer passionate about building projects benefiting makers and builders, founded the Jobstash organization in September 2022, and we built Ecosystem Vision thanks to a grant from ThankArb, delivering the platform in September 20204.
 
 ## Source of Funds
 
 Grants have been an instrumental source of funding for our project.
 We are prod to have been supported by ThankArb.
 
 ## Use of Funds
 
 Funds received will cover infrastructure bills and support our engineers in working full-time without external influences. Our costs include GitHub, OpenAI, Figma, hosting, and various software vendor licenses. We aim to compensate our contributors fairly, considering living costs in their regions across Europe, Southeast Asia, and Africa.",https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/608/97

 At the Breadchain Cooperative, we want to prove that the economic design space enabled by crypto allows for the development of innovative, sustainable methods of funding and co-governing resources that were not possible before.
 
 This grant will help us to develop additional solidarity primitives in order to establish a vibrant ecology of projects, applications, and individuals who collectively govern resources.
